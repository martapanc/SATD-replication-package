99f983249e Rejigger how binding works with files and line numbers. It appears that we weren't tracking everything we needed in a binding. Instead of holding the current frame plus the current file+line, we held only the current frame. This led to us constantly setting and clearing the frame's line numbers in an attempt to get traces to line up. With binding carrying the original file+line, that juggling is no longer necessary. This fixes an eval spec and should improve backtraces across eval calls, which had numerous peculiarities before. This also fixes JRUBY-2328: Overriding require causes eval to give wrong __FILE__ in certain circumstances.
