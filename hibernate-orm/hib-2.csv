// This functionality should eventually go away, as it is replaced by model exporters
// This is a kludge to deal with enumerators, which crash the doSwitch
//FB TBD can we come up with a better algorithm for choosing the default label feature?
//DMS Why not this?
// Second alternative should be getModelProject()?
// This is a big festering hack to make the images the right size from the start
// if there are multiple variables in declaration
// TODO handle class cast exception better.
// TODO // This is faster than many charAt() calls
// Note that the way they are sorted, the values of index[i++] always increase
// //TBD rethink where exactly some of the following methods belong (GenModel or GenPackage)
//DMS  Do a better job with specific exceptions? Just use chained RuntimeExceptions?
// This is copied from ItemProviderAdapterFactory
// The eAnnotations and eGenericType are possible containment references
// call the workaround
// TODO So what should be the eType be now?
// TODO Hack that should be removed.
// REVISIT: Remove this code
// Assume that it's an attribute for now
// TODO This is really quite attrocious since there is code that will assume an iterator that returns strings!
// Why? -- In many cases
// Ensure that this race condition is thread safe
// Because of the old factoring approach in the create method
// Unused?
// Motif kludge: we would get something random instead of null
//DMS should we let this exception out?
// Specialize this to return a resource locator for messages specific to this validator
// Do nothing for now, and avoid propagating the exception
// Only file-scheme URIs will be re-encoded. If a URI was decoded in the workaround
// TODO fix the space above
// EATM this would be wrong.
// TODO factor up into GenBaseImpl
// TODO deprecate (since getPluginClass() is no longer called)
// this is a fall-back, however, this should never be called
//DMS handle this well.
// EATM Kind of hacky.
//DMS factor this into a method? Use a non-static subclass? 
// TODO deprecate (since no longer used by getEditPluginClass()
// This runs the operation, and shows progress
// EATM Demand create metadata
//REVISIT: do we really need to support block names as in Unicode 3.1
// TODO REMOVE THIS BOGUS EMPTY LINE
// Note: Registry based authority is being removed from
// call workaround
// TODO // I'm concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403
// I don't know if we should be run this deferred
// temporary structure to hold node's attributes + namespaces in scope
//DMS this doesn't really produce nice output
// If the delegate URI can be handled as a file
// The label is not used
//DMS What if Eclipse is running, but an invalid facade has been specified?
// EATM Call the deprecated method which does the same thing
// This assumes we only get a SET notification, which isn't a good assumption
// EATM This might be better written as a single loop for the EObject case?
// if there are multiple variables in declaration
// Per Schema 1.0 it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid URI
// HACK: reading encoding
//TBD return (user selected subset?) of referenced packages that contain super classes of classes in this package.
// REVISIT: Remove this code.
// TODO factor up into GenBaseImpl?
