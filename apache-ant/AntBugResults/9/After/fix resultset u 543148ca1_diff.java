 Changes from Ant 1.7.x TO current SVN version
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * Improved handling of InterruptException (lets suppose someone/thing is
   trying to kill the thread when we receive an InterruptException),
   when an InterruptException is received, we do not wait anymore in a while
   loop till the end time has been reached. Bugzilla report 42924.
 
 * Refactor PropertyHelper and introspection APIs to make extension more
   granular and support setting task/type attribute values to objects
   decoded by custom PropertyEvaluator delegates. Also add <propertyhelper>
   task for registering delegates and/or replacing the registered PropertyHelper
   instance.  Bugzilla report 42736.
 
 * Added a restricted form of typedef called <componentdef>. This allows
   definition of elements that can only be within tasks or types. This
   method is now used to define conditions, selectors and selectors. This
   means that tasks may now have nested conditions just by implementing
   the Condition interface, rather than extending ConditionBase. It also
   means that the use of namespaces for some of the selectors introduced
   in Ant 1.7.0 is no longer necessary.
   Implementing this means that the DynamicElement work-around introduced
   in Ant 1.7.0 has been removed.
   Bugzilla report 40511.
 
 * In the <touch> task when a <mapper> is used, the millis and datetime
   attributes now override the time of the source resource if provisioned. 
   Bugzilla report 43235.
 
 * Remove fall-back mechanism for references that are not resolved
   during normal runtime execution.
 
 * FileUtils.createTempFile now actually creates the file.
   The TempFile task still does not create the file by default, can be instructed
   to do so however using a new parameter.
   Bugzilla report 33969.
   
 * A lock in Project ensured that a BuildListener's messageLogged
   method was only ever executed by a single thread at a time, while
   all other methods could be invoked by multiple threads
   simultaniously (while within <parallel>, for example).  This lock is
   no longer in place, messageLogged should be made thread-safe now.
 
  * <sql>'s onError="stop" no longer fails the build if an error
    occurs,  this is the main difference between stop and error and
    matches what the documentation implied.
    Bugzilla Report 24668.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
  * <symlink> task couldn't overwrite existing symlinks that pointed to nonexistent files
    Bugzilla report 38199.
 
  * <symlink> task couldn't overwrite files that were in the way of the symlink.
    Bugzilla report 43426.
    
  * <symlink> task failonerror="false" does not stop build from failing when 'ln' 
    command returns non-zero. Bugzilla report 43624  
 
  * <touch> task couldn't differentiate between "no resources specified" and "no resources
    matched."  Bugzilla report 43799.
 
  * ManifestClassPath throws when a relative path would traverse the file system root. Bugzilla
    report 44499.
 
  * <globmapper> had an indexoutofbounds when the prefix and postfix overlapped. Bugzilla report
    44731.
    
  * <typedef> and <taskdef> failed to accept file names with #
    characters in them.
    Bugzilla report 45190
 
  * A deadlock could occur if a BuildListener tried to access an Ant property
    within messageLogged while a different thread also accessed one.
    Bugzilla report 45194
 
  * Handle null result of system getProperty() in CommandlineJava.
    Similar to Bugzilla report 42334.
 
  * Length task did not process nonexistent Resources even though these might
    conceivably still carry file length information.  Bugzilla report 45271.
 
  * <javac>'s includeJavaRuntime="false" should work for gcj now.  Note
    that you may need to set includeAntRuntime to false in order to
    have full control.
    Bugzilla Report 34638.
 
+ * <sql> would fail if the executed statment didn't return a result
+   set with some JDBC driver that dissalow Statement.getResultSet to
+   be called in such a situation.
+   Bugzilla report 36265 
+
+ * if the executed statement in <sql> returned a result set and an
+   update count, the count would be lost.
+
+ * if an executed statement in <sql> mixes update count and result set
+   parts, some result sets wouldn't get printed.
+   Bugzilla Report 32168.
+
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
  * There is now a FileProvider interface for resources that act as a source
    of filenames. This should be used by tasks that require resources
    to provide filenames, rather than require that all resources
    are instances or subclasses of FileResource.
    Bugzilla report 43348
    
  * Fixcrlf now gives better error messages on bad directory attributes.
    Bugzilla report 43936
    
  * a new property ant.project.default-target holds the value of the
    current <project>'s default attribute.
 
  * a new property ant.project.invoked-targets holds a comma separated
    list of the targets that have been specified on the command line
    (the IDE, an <ant> task ...) when invoking the current project.
 
  * The <type> resource selector has had an "any" type added for better
    configurability.
 
  * Ant should detect the OS as both a Mac and a Unix system when
    running on OpenJDK.
    Bugzilla Report 44889.
 
  * new protected getConnection and getStatement methods allow
    subclasses of SQLExec more control - or access to the cached
    instances when overriding other methods like runStatements.
    Bugzilla Report 27178.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.7.0 TO Ant 1.7.1
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * String resources only have properties single expanded. If you relied on
   <string> resources being expanded more than once, it no longer happens.
   Bugzilla report 42277.
 
 * A String resource's encoding attribute was only taken into account when
   set from the resource's OutputStream; the InputStream provided the String's
   binary content according to the platform's default encoding. Behavior has
   been modified to encode outgoing (InputStream) content as well as encoding
   incoming (OutputStream) content.
 
 * <java> with fork now returns gives -1 instead of 0 as result when failonerror
   is false and some exception (including timeout) occurs. Br 42377. 
 
 * ant-type attribute has been marked as deprecated and a warning has been
   issued if it is encountered in the build file.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * The default logger was failing to print complete stack traces for exceptions
   other than BuildException, thus omitting often important diagnostic
   information. Bugzilla 43398.
 
 * Error in FTP task
   Bugzilla report 41724
 
 * Regression: Locator fails with URI encoding problem when spaces in path
   Bugzilla report 42222

 * Improvements in AntClassLoader Speed.
   Bugzilla report 42259
 
 * Error in handling of some permissions, most notably the AllPermission on
   jdk 1.5

   execution.
   Bugzilla report 41284
 
 * Bug in org.apache.tools.ant.types.resources.comparators.Date
   Bugzilla report 41411
 
 * <junit> in Ant 1.7.0 could throw NPE if no <classpath> was defined.
   Bugzilla report 41422.
 
 * In Ant 1.7.0, <fileset> in <javadoc> does not by default include only
   **/*.java as the documentation claims and earlier revisions did.
   Bugzilla report 41264.
 
 * SPI support in jar was broken.
   Bugzilla report 41201.
   
 * jsch-0.1.30 causes SCP task to hang
   Bugzilla report 41090.
 
 * Target from imported file listed twice in projecthelp.
   Bugzilla report 41226.
 
 * <sql> task double-expands properties if expandproperties is true,
   and expands properties if expandproperties is false.
   Bugzilla report 41204.
 
 * Rolling back Bugzilla 32927 (set a default description for a javadoc tag
   if not set) as it caused a BC problem.
   Bugzilla report 41268.
 
 * <apt> forks properly and so memory settings are picked up.
   Bug report 41280.
 
 * Regression: NPE was thrown when using <pathconvert> against a
   (third-party instantiated) fileset with null Project reference.
 
 * Strip out all -J arguments to non forking rmic adapters, specifically
   the Sun and Weblogic compilers.
   Bug report 41349
 
 * Synchonization issues in PropertyHelper.  Bugzilla 41353.
 
 * <concat binary="true" append="true"> did not append.  Bugzilla 41399.
  
 * -autoproxy turns Java1.5+ automatic proxy support on. Bugzilla 41904
 
 * Handle null result of system getProperty(). Bugzilla 42334.
 
 * Regression: concat fixlastline="true" should not have applied to
   nested text, but did in Ant 1.7.0. Bugzilla 42369.
 
 * Regression: ant.version was not passed down in <ant>, <subant>.
   This worked in Ant 1.6.5, but not in 1.7.0.
   ant.core.lib (added in 1.7.0) was also not being propagated.
   Bugzilla bug 42263
 
 * Regression: bzip2 task created corrupted output files for some inputs.
   Bugzilla bug 41596.

   a second time. Bugzilla 43121.
 
 * FilterMapper could throw an NPE.
   Bugzilla 43292.
 
 * Regession nested macrodefs with elements could cause StackOverFlow.
   Bugzilla 43324.
 
 * Some changes to <junit> broke third party tasks that extend it (like
   Apache Cactus' Ant task).  The changes have been modified so that
   subclases should now work again - without any changes to the
   subclass.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Various small optimizations speed up common tasks such as <javac> on large
   filesets, reducing both I/O and CPU usage.
 
 * Profiling logger has been added with basic profiling capabilities.
 
 * <script> now has basic support for JavaFX scripts
 
 * SSH task can now take a command parameter containing the commands to execute.
   This allows you to connect to a server and execute a number of commands
   without constantly reconnecting for each command.
 
 * Upgraded XML API to XML commons version 1.3.04.
 
 * Upgraded to Xerces 2.9.0
 
 * <script> can now work with bsf.jar and js.jar in its <classpath>.
 
 * add errorProperty and updatedProperty to <javac>
   Bugzilla 35637 and 28941.
 
 * add classpathref attribute to <whichresource>
   Bugzilla 41158.
 
 * reduce logging noise of <apply skipemptyfilesets="true">
   Bugzilla 29154
 
 * Show Previous Revision in the tagdiff.xsl stylesheet
   Bugzilla 29143
 
 * Allow <mapper refid> to refer directly to a FileNameMapper instance.
 
 * If you try and use a type in a namespace (or an antlib), and the type is not
   recognized but there are other definitions in that namespace, Ant lists what
   the known definitions are. This helps you find spelling errors.
 
 * Add a <last> resource collection, corresponding to <first>.
 
 * Add new <truncate> task.
 
 * <junitreport> xsl stylesheets allow setting the title used in <title> and <h1> tags by
   using <report><param> element.  Bugzilla 41742.
 
 * Add IgnoreDependenciesExecutor for weird cases when the user wants to run
   only the targets explicitly specified.
 
 * Patternset allows nested inverted patternsets using <invert>.
 
 * <manifest> checks for validity of attribute names.
 
 * JUnitVersionHelper.getTestCaseClassName is now public. Bugzilla 42231
 
 * <string> resource supports nested text. Bugzilla bug 42276
 
 * <scriptdef> now sources scripts from nested resources/resource collections. This lets you
   define scripts in JARs, remote URLs, or any other supported resource. Bugzilla report 41597.
 
 * <concat> is now usable as a single-element ResourceCollection.
 
 * It is now possible to provide the value of a <striplinecomments> filter's
   <comment> nested element as nested text instead of using the 'value'
   attribute.
 
 * A new logger, BigProjectLogger, lists the project name with every target   
 
 * Default text added to macrodef. Bugzilla report 42301.
 
 * "rawblobs" attribute added to SQL task.
 
 * Add new retry task container.
 
 * <jar> has a new strict attribute that checks if the jar complies with
   the jar packaging version specification.
 
 * <javac> has a new attribute - includeDestClasses.
   Bugzilla 40776.
 
 * <fileset> has a new attribute - errorOnMissingDir.
   Bugzilla 11270.
 
 * <javac> handles package-info.java files, there were repeatedly compiled.
   Bugzilla 43114.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.6.5 to Ant 1.7.0
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * Initial support for JDK 6 (JSR 223) scripting.
   <*script*> tasks will now use javax.scripting if BSF is
   not available, or if explicitly requested by using
   a "manager" attribute.
 
 * Removed launcher classes from nodeps jar.
 
 * <classconstants> filter reader uses ISO-8859-1 encoding to read
   the java class file. Bugzilla report 33604.
 
 * Defer reference process. Bugzilla 36955, 34458, 37688.
   This may break build files in which a reference was set in a target which was
   never executed. Historically, Ant would set the reference early on, during parse
   time, so the datatype would be defined. Now it requires the reference to have
   been in a bit of the build file which was actually executed. If you get
   an error about an undefined reference, locate the reference and move it somewhere
   where it is used, or fix the depends attribute of the target in question to
   depend on the target which defines the reference/datatype.
   As a result of testing on real live build scripts, a fall-back mechanism
   was put it place to allow references that are out-of-band to be resolved. If
   this happens a big warning message is logged. This fall-back mechanism will
   be removed in Ant 1.8.0.
 
 * <script> and <scriptdef> now set the current thread context.
 
 * Unrestrict the dbvendor names in the websphere element of the ejbjar task.
   Bugzilla Report 40475.
 
 * <env> nested element in <java>, <exec> and others is now case-insensitive
   for windows OS. Bugzilla Report 28874.
 
 * Removed support for xalan1 completely. Users of Xalan1 for Ant builds will
   have to stay at ant 1.6.5 or upgrade to xalan2.
 
 * Use org.apache.log4j.Logger instead of org.apache.log4j.Category.
   Category has been deprecated for ~2 years and has been removed from
   the log4j code.  Logger was introduced in log4j 1.2 so users of
   log4j 1.1 and log4j 1.0 need to upgrade to a newer version of log4j.
   Bugzilla Report 31951.
 
 * build.sysclasspath now also affects the bootclasspath handling of
   spawned Java VMs.  If you set build.sysclasspath to anything other
   than "ignore" (or leave it unset, since "ignore" is the default when
   it comes to bootclasspath handling), then the bootclasspath of the
   VM running Ant will be added to the bootclasspath you've specified.
 
 * The <java fork="false"> now as per default installs a security manager
   using the default permissions. This is now independent of the
   failonerror attribute.  Bugzilla report 33361.
 
 * <signjar> now notices when the jar and signedjar are equal, and switches
   to the same dependency logic as when signedjar is omitted. This may break
   something that depended upon signing in this situation. However, since
   invoking the JDK jarsigner program with -signedjar set to the source jar
   actually crashes the JVM on our (Java1.5) systems, we don't think any
   build files which actually worked will be affected by the change.
 
 * <signjar> used to ignore a nested fileset when a jar was also provided as an
   attribute, printing a warning message; now it signs files in the fileset.
 
 * An improved method of handling timestamp granularity differences between
   client and server was added to the <ftp> task.  FTP servers typically
   have HH:mm timestamps whereas local filesystems have HH:mm:ss timestamps.
   Previously, this required tweaking with the timediffmillis attribute
   which also was used to handle timezone differences.  Now, there is a new
   timestampgranularity attribute.  The default value for get operations is 0
   since the user has the more powerful preservelastmodified attribute to work
   with.  Since this is not available on put operations the default value
   adds a minute to the server timestamp in order to account for this,
   Scripts which previously used timediffmillis to do this compensation may
   need to be rewritten.  timediffmillis has now been deprecated.
 
 * Support for the XSL:P XML parser has been removed.
   Bugzilla Report 23455.
 
 * Visual Age for Java optional tasks removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * Testlet (test) optional task removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * IContract optional task removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * Metamata (maudit, mmetrics, and mparse tasks) removed as the required 
   library is no longer available.
 
 * Sitraka (jpcoverage, jpcovmerge, jpcovreport) tasks suppressed as the 
   required library is no longer available.
 
 * <fixcrlf> used \r (Mac) line endings on OS X, whose proper line separator
   is \n (Unix).  Bugzilla report 39585.
 
 * <scp> now optionally supports the sftp protocol, you may need a
   newer jsch.jar.  Bugzilla Report 39373.
 
 * Ant launcher program prints errors to stderr, and exits with a 2 exit code
   value if, for any reason, it cannot actually start Ant proper. This will only
   affect programs/scripts that called the launcher and which did not want to
   receive an error if Ant itself would not start
 
 * All .NET tasks are now deprecated in favor of the new .NET Antlib:
   http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/dotnet/index.html

   not e.g. pick up files that didn't exist the first time through.
   Bugzilla 41151.
 
 * OOM caused by IH holding on to classes and thus their classloaders.
   Bugzilla 28283 and 33061.
 
 * <delete> doesnt delete when defaultexcludes="false" and no includes is set
   fixed. Bugzilla 40313.

 * ant.bat now looks in %USERPROFILE% and %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in addition to
   %HOME% for pre/post batch files. Bugzilla report 39298.
 
 * The inheritance hierarchy of the legacy <path> type was changed; code built
   against Ant 1.7 would therefore no longer execute on older versions of Ant.
   Since <path> is historically heavily used this was undesirable, and since it
   is also avoidable, the change to <path>'s taxonomy was reverted.

 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Warn user when a reference in the form "${refid}" cannot be resolved as this
   is a sign they probably meant "refid" (misuse of property expansion syntax).
 
 * Add dtd to javadoc for junit.
   Bugzilla 40754.
 
 * Add quiet attribute to loadfile/resource.
   Bugzilla 38249.

 * Upgraded XML API and parser to Xerces 2.8.1
 
 * A code review of some threaded logic has tightened up the synchronization
   of Watchdog, ExecuteWatchdog and ExecuteJava, which could reduce the occurence
   of race conditions here, especially on Java1.5+.
 
 * Allow broken reference build files. The defer reference processing would
   break too many files - so allow them with a warning.
 
 * Removed dependency on sun.misc.UUEncoder for UUMailer.
 
 * Added regex attribute to the echoproperties task.
   Bugzilla 40019.
 
 * <war> task now allows you to omit the web.xml file. as this is optional

   avoid a missing web.xml file from halting the build.
 
 * Diagnostics catches and logs security exceptions when accessing system properties.
 
 * <javadoc> useexternalfile now applies to all command line arguments
   of javadoc. Bugzilla report 40852.

   of noisey tests. Bugzilla report 12817.
 
 * Log level of message 'Overriding previous definition of reference to'
   set to Verbose. Bugzilla report 17240.
 
 * Added setbeans attribute to <script> to allow <script>'s to be

   Report 37546.
 
 * The Reference class now has a project field that will get
   used (if set) in preference to the passed in project, when
   dereferencing the reference. Bugzilla Report 25777.
 
 * On DOS and Netware, filenames beginning with a drive letter
   and followed by a colon but with no directory separator following
   the colon are no longer (incorrectly) accepted as absolute pathnames
   by FileUtils.normalize() and FileUtils.isAbsolutePath().  Netware
   volumes can still be specified without an intervening separator.
   UNC pathnames on Windows must include a server and share name, i.e.
   "\\a\b" to be considered valid absolute paths.
 
 * A bug in SQLExec would prevent the execution of trailing,
   non-semicolon-delimited statements.  Bugzilla Report 37764.

 * <WsdlToDotnet> and <style> are now deprecated in favor of <wsdltodotnet> and
   <xslt>, respectively. Bugzilla report 25832.
 
 * <echoproperties> now (alphanumerically) sorts the property list
   before echoing. Bugzilla report 18976.
 
 * A new base class DispatchTask has been added to facilitate elegant
   creation of tasks with multiple actions.
 
 * Major revision of <wsdltodotnet>. Supports mono wsdl and the microsoft
   wsdl run on mono, as well as most of the .NET WSE2.0 options. Extra
   schemas (files or urls) can be named in the <schema> element.
   Compilers can be selected using the compiler attribute, which defaults
   to "microsoft" on windows, and "mono" on everything else.
 
 * It is now possible to specify the pattern created/parsed by <checksum>.
   Bugzilla Report 16539.
 
 * Added a new "failall" value for the onerror attribute of <typedef>.

 * ant -diagnostics lists contents of ${user.home}/.ant/lib , and
   checks that the java.io.tmpdir directory exists and is writeable.
 
 * mail task accepts nested header element.  Bugzilla report 24713.
 
 * zip/jar/war/ear supports level attribute for deflate compression level.
   Bugzilla report 25513.
 
 * Added loginputstring attribute to the redirector type.
 
 * Tighten security by sending storepass and keypass to signjar
   via the input stream of the forked process.
 
 * New task <schemavalidate> extends <xmlvalidate> with extra support
   for XML Schema (XSD) files.
 
 * <fixcrlf> supports a file attribute for easy fixup of a single file.
 
 * New condition <parsersupports> which can look for XML parser feature or
   property support in the parser Ant is using.
 
 * fixcrlf can be used in a filterchain.
 
 * <sync> has a new nested element <preserveInTarget> that can be used
   to protect extra-content in the target directory.  Bugzilla Report
   21832.
 
 * <signjar> now supports:
   -nested filesets at the same time as the jar attribute
   -a destDir attribute with the appropriate dependency logic, which
    can be used with the jar attribute or nested filesets
   -a mapper to permit filename remapping on signing
   -tsaurl and tsacert attributes for timestamped JAR signing
   -nested <sysproperty> elements, which can be used for proxy setup
   and the like
 
 * The linecontains and linecontainsregexp filterreaders now support a
   negate attribute to select lines -not- containing specified text.
   Bugzilla Report 34374.
 
 * <os> condition adds "winnt" as a family which can be tested. This is
   all windows platforms other than the Win9x line or Windows CE.
 
 * <exec> (and hence, <apply> and any other derived classes) have an OsFamily
   attribute, which can restrict execution to a single OS family.
 
 * Added "backtrace" attribute to macrodef. Bugzilla report 27219.
 
 * Ant main provides some diagnostics if it ever sees a -cp or -lib option,
   as this is indicative of a script mismatch. Bugzilla report 34860
 
 * <junitreport> prints a special message if supplied an empty XML File. This
   can be caused by the test JVM exiting during a test, either via a
   System.exit() call or a JVM crash.
 
 * Project name is now used for *all* targets so one can write consistent import
   build files. Bugzilla report 28444.
 
 * New condition <typefound> that can be used to probe for the declaration
   and implementation of a task, type, preset, macro, scriptdef, whatever.
   As it tests for the implementation, it can be used to check for optional
   tasks being available.
 
 * Check for 1.5.* Ant main class. (weblogic.jar in classpath reports)
 
 * New condition <isfailure> that tests the return-code of an executable. This
   contains platform-specific logic and is better than comparing the result with
   "0".
 
 * Added initial support for Resource Collections, including the
   resourcecount task.
 
 * property attribute of pathconvert is now optional. If omitted the
   result will be written to the log.
 
 * New mapper, <scriptmapper>, supports scripted mapping of source files/strings
   to destination strings.
 
 * Add the echoxml task. This will echo nested XML to a file, with
   the normal <?xml ?> processor instruction. UTF-8 encoding only; no-namespace
   support.
 
 * Try to make subprojects of custom Project subclasses instances of the
   same type. Bugzilla report 17901.
 
 * <ssh> and <scp> support keyboard-interactive authentication now.
 
 * <javadoc> now supports -breakiterator for custom doclets if Ant is
   running on JSE 5.0 or higher.  Bugzilla Report: 34580.
 
 * New logger, TimestampedLogger, that prints the wall time that a build
   finished/failed. Use with
   -logger org.apache.tools.ant.listener.TimestampedLogger
 
 * <junitreport> now generates pages alltests-errors.html and
   alltests-fails.html, that list only the errors and failures, respectively.
   Bugzilla Report: 36226
 
 * New task <makeurl> that can turn a file reference into an absolute file://
   url; and nested filesets/paths into a (space, comma, whatever) separated
   list of URLs. Useful for RMI classpath setup, amongst other things.
 
 * <xslt> now accepts nested FileNameMappers e.g. <globmapper>.
   Bugzilla report 37604.
 
 * New task <loadresource> that accompanies <loadfile> for non file resources.
 
 * <echo> now supports an encoding when saving to a file.
 
 * New GreedyInputHandler added.
 
 * Add textfile attribute to the <filesmatch> condition. When true, the text
   contents of the two files are compared, ignoring line ending differences.
 
 * New <resourcesmatch> condition.
 
 * Added the onmissingfiltersfile attribute to filterset. Bugzilla report 19845.
 
 * Added the inline handler element to the input task.
 
 * <sql> supports property expansion if you set the expandProperties
   attribute. By default it does not expand properties, something we
   dare not change for fear of breaking complex SQL operations in
   existing files.
 
 * <javadoc>'s packagenames attribute is now optional and defaults to "*".
 
 * <javac>'s source and target attributes as well as <javadoc>'s source
   attribute will read default values from the properties
   ant.build.javac.source and ant.build.javac.target.
 
 * Handling of ' ', '#' in CLASSPATH and '#' in -lib (cannot use ' '
   in -lib on UNIX at the moment). Bugzilla Report 39295.
 
 * <scp> now optionally supports the sftp protocol.  Bugzilla Report 39373.
 
 * Resources can now be used to indicate the location of the stylesheet to use
   in <xslt>. Bugzilla Report 39407.
 
 * New <antversion> condition. Bugzilla report 32804.
 
 * ReplaceTokens should allow properties files. Bugzilla report 39688.
 
 * FTP Account could not be specified in ant FTP task. Bugzilla report 39720.
 
 * Minor performance updates. Bugzilla report 39565.
 
 * New deleteonexit attribute for the <tempfile> task. Bugzilla report 39842.
   Remember that the exit of the JVM can be a long time coming,
