373a03821 bug 52968 added a call to processSampler in order to mark the transaction sampler in error and generate the associated sampler result. Add an explanation for that and extract that code in a dedicated method to make clear that the triggerEndOfLoopOnParentControllers will not process any new sampler #resolve #56
