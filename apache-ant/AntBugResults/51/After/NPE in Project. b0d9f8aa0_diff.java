 Changes from Ant 1.8.1 TO current SVN version
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
  * Prior to Ant 1.8.0 the <copy> task and several other tasks would
    overwrite read-only destination files.  Starting with 1.8.0 they
    would only do so under special circumstances.  Ant 1.8.2 now
    consistently won't replace a read-only file by default. The same is
    true for a number of other tasks.
    The <copy>, <move> and <echo> tasks now have a new force attribute
    and <concat> has a new forceReadonly attribute that can be used to
    make the task overwrite read-only destinations.
    Bugzilla Report 49261.
 
  * Removed ant-nodeps.jar; it is now merged into ant.jar.
 
  * DOMElementWriter#encode used to employ special code before encoding
    ampersands so that &#123; remained &#123; rather than being turned
    into &amp;#123;.  This is no longer the case, ampersands will now
    be encoded unconditionally.
    Also DOMElementWriter#encodeData will treat CDATA sections containing a
    literal "]]>" sequence different now - it will split the CDATA
    section between the second "]" and ">" and create two sections.
    This affects <echoxml> task as well as the XML logger or JUnit
    formatter where ampersands will now always get encoded.
    In addition DOMElementWriter will now replace the characters \t, \r
    and \n in attribute values by entity references.
    Bugzilla Report 49404.
 
  * The list elements returned by ProjectHelper#getExtensionStack are
    now String arrays of length 3 rather than 2 in order to support the
    onMissingExtensionPoint attribute.
    Bugzilla Report 49473.   
 
  * When using <property file="..." prefix="..."/> properties defined
    inside the same file will only get used in expansions if the ${}
    reference uses the same prefix.  This is different from Ant 1.8.1
    but is the same behavior Ant 1.8.0 and earlier exhibited.
    A new attribute prefixValues can be used to re-enable the behavior
    of Ant 1.8.1.
    Bugzilla Report 49373.
 
  * The files and directories used by Git, Mercurial and Bazaar to
    store their information are now excluded by the defaultexcludes.
    Bugzilla Report 49624.
 
  * The <junit> task no longer generates TestListener events - which
    have been introduced in ant 1.7.0 - by default.  The task has a new
    attribute enableTestListenerEvents and a new "magic" property
    ant.junit.enabletestlistenerevents has been added that can be used
    to reinstate the old behavior.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
  * mmap-based file copy problems under JDK 1.4 on Linux.
    Bugzilla Report 49430.
 
  * The Sun JVM tries to mmap the entire file during a copy. 
    For large files this is not feasible. 
    We now explicitly request to copy at most 16 MiB per request.
    Bugzilla Report 49326.
    
  * DemuxInputStream.read() should return unsigned values
    Bugzilla Report 49279.
 
  * The MIME mailer ignored the port parameter when using SSL.
    Bugzilla Report 49267.
 
  * <xslt> ignored the classpath when using the default TraX processor.
    Bugzilla Report 49271.
 
  * <checksum>'s totalproperty only worked reliably if the same file
    name didn't occur inside more than one directory.
    Bugzilla Report 36748.
 
  * <ftp> could fail to download files from remote subdirectories under
    certain circumstances.
    Bugzilla Report 49296.
 
  * <junit> will now produce better diagnostics when it fails to delete
    a temporary file.
    Bugzilla Report 49419.
 
  * Ant would often scan directories even though there were known to
    only hold excluded files when evaluating filesets.  This never
    resulted in wrong results but degraded performance of the scan
    itself.
    Bugzilla Report 49420.
 
  * <javac> failed for long command lines on OS/2.
    Bugzilla Report 49425.
 
  * <junitreport> did not handle encodings well for stdout/stderr.
    Bugzilla Report 49418.
 
  * <junit> could issue a warning about multiple versions of Ant on the
    CLASSPATH if two CLASSPATH entries differed in case on a
    case-insensitive file system.
    Bugzilla Report 49041.
 
  * The <restrict> resource collection was checking every resource even if
    we actually just want the first one, like in the example of use of
    resourcelist in the documentation (getting the first available resource
    from a mirror list).
 
  * A race condition could lead to build failures if multiple <mkdir>
    tasks were trying to create the same directory.
    Bugzilla Report 49572.
 
  * the toString() method of the Resources class - and thus any
    ${toString:} expansion of a reference to a <resources> element -
    didn't iterate over its nested elements if it hadn't done so prior
    to the toString invocation already.
    Bugzilla Report 49588.
 
  * <apply> in parallel mode didn't work together with a nested
    <redirector> if maxparallel was <= 0 (the default) or no source
    files matched.
    Bugzilla Report 49594.
 
  * <jar filesetmanifest="merge"> didn't work for manifests added via
    <zipfileset>s that used the prefix or fullpath attributes.
    Bugzilla Report 49605.
 
  * <tempfile createfile="true"> would cause an error unless the prefix
    attribute has been specified.
    Bugzilla Report 49755.
 
  * If forked, after finished <java> was still reading the input stream
    for a bunch of characters, then stealing them from a following <input>.
    Bugzilla Report 49119.
 
  * Ant could be leaking threads for each forked process (started by
    <exec>, <apply>, <java> or similar tasks) that didn't receive input
    from a resource or string explicitly.
    Bugzilla Report 49587.
 
+ * Project#setDefault threw an excpetion when null was passed in as
+   argument, even though the javadoc says, null is a valid value.
+   Bugzilla Report 49803.
+
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
  * <concat>'s force attribute has been deprecated in favor of a new
    overwrite attribute that is consistent with <copy>'s attribute
    names.
 
  * You can now specify a list of methods to run in a JUnit test case.
    Bugzilla Report 34748.
 
  * properties in files read because of the -propertyfile command line
    option will now get resolved against other properties that are
    defined before the project starts executing (those from the same or
    earlier -propertfiles or defined via the -D option).
    Bugzilla Report 18732.
 
  * <pathelement>s can now contain wildcards in order to use wildcard
    CLASSPATH entries introduced with Java6.
    The wildcards are not expanded or even evaluated by Ant and will be
    used literally.  The resulting path may be unusable as a CLASSPATH
    for Java versions prior to Java6 and likely doesn't mean anything
    when used in any other way than a CLASSPATH for a forked Java VM. 
    Bugzilla Report 46842.
 
  * A new attribute allows targets to deal with non-existant extensions
    points, i.e. they can extend and extension-point if it has been
    defined or silently work as plain targets if it hasn't.  This is
    useful for targets that get included/imported in different
    scenarios where a given extension-point may or may not exist.
    Bugzilla Report 49473.   
 
  * Ant now logs a warning message if it fails to change the file
    modification time in for example when using <touch> or preserving
    timestamps in various tasks.
    Bugzilla Report 49485.
 
  * ProjectHelpers can now be installed dynamically via the <projecthelper>
    Ant task.
 
  * <import> is now able to switch to the proper ProjectHelper to parse
    the imported resource. This means that several kinds of different build
    files can import each other.
 
  * <copy tofile=""> now also works for non-filesystem resources.
    Bugzilla Report 49756.
 
  * The <linecontainsregexp> filter now supports a casesensitive
    attribute.
 
  * The <containsregexp> selector now supports casesensitive, multiline
    and singleline attributes.
    Bugzilla Report 49764.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.8.0 TO Ant 1.8.1 
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
  * ant-trax.jar is no longer produced since TrAX is included in JDK 1.4+.
 
  * Ant no longer ships with Apache Xerces-J or the XML APIs but relies
    on the Java runtime to provide a parser and matching API versions.
    
  * The stylebook ant task and the ant-stylebook.jar are removed.  
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
  * Tasks that iterate over task or type definitions, references or
    targets now iterate over copies instead of the live maps to avoid
    ConcurrentModificationExceptions if another thread changes the
    maps.
    Bugzilla Report 48310.
 
  * The filesmatch condition threw a NullPointerException when
    comparing text files and the second file contained fewer lines than
    the first one.
    Bugzilla Report 48715.
 
  * Regression: The <ear> task would allow multiple
    META-INF/application.xml files to be added.
    Bugzilla Report 6836.
 
  * VectorSet#remove(Object) would fail if the size of the vector
    equaled its capacity.
    
  * Regression : ant -diagnostics was returning with exit code 1
    Bugzilla Report 48782
    
  * Fix for exec task sometimes inserts extraneous newlines
    Bugzilla Report 48746
    
  * SymlinkTest#testSymbolicLinkUtilsMethods failing on MacOS
    Bugzilla Report 48785.
 
  * If <concat>'s first resourcecollection child is a <resources>,
    any subsequently added child resourcecollection joins the first.
    Bugzilla Report 48816.        
    
  * <get> with an invalid URL could trigger an NPE in some JVMs.
    Bugzilla Report 48833
    
  * Broken Pipe issue under Ubuntu Linux
    Bugzilla Report 48789
    
  * Properties wrongly read from file or not update during read
    Bugzilla Report 48768       
 
  * AntClassLoader in Ant 1.8.0 has been considerably slower than in
    1.7.1
    Bugzilla Report 48853
    
  * ANT_CMD_LINE_ARGS are rippling through lower level Ant usage 
    Bugzilla Report 48876
    
  * email : IO error sending mail with plain mimetype
    Bugzilla Report 48932    
 
  * the complete-ant-cmd.pl script failed to create a proper cache of
    target if "ant -p" failed.
    Bugzilla Report 48980
 
  * <rmic>'s sourcebase attribute was broken.
    Bugzilla Report 48970
 
  * <copy>'s failonerror didn't work as expected when copying a single
    element resource collection to a file.
    Bugzilla Report 49070
 
  * <get> no longer followed redirects if the redirect URL was relative
    and not an absolute URL.
    Bugzilla Report 48972
 
  * fixed a performance degradation in the code that expands property
    references.
    Bugzilla Reports 48961 and 49079
 
  * <jar filesetmanifest="merge"> was broken on Windows.
    Bugzilla Report 49090
 
  * <symlink> delete failed if the link attribute was a relative path
    to a link inside the current directory without a leading ".".
    Bugzilla Report 49137
 
  * <telnet> and <rexec> failed to find the expected strings when
    waiting for responses and thus always failed.
    Bugzilla Report 49173
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
  * Project provides new get methods that return copies instead of the
    live maps of task and type definitions, references and targets.
 
  * Ant is now more lenient with ZIP extra fields and will be able to
    read archives that it failed to read in earlier versions.
    Bugzilla Report 48781.
 
  * The <zip> family of tasks has been sped up for bigger archives.
    Bugzilla Report 48755.
    
  * Add removeKeepExtension option to NetRexxC task.
    Bugzilla Report 48788.
 
  * Add prefix attribute to loadproperties task.
 
  * Add resource attribute to length task.
 
  * PropertyResource will effectively proxy another Resource if ${name}
    evaluates to a Resource object.
 
  * Added forcestring attribute to equals condition to force evaluation
    of Object args as strings; previously only API-level usage of the
    equals condition allowed Object args, but Ant 1.8.x+ property
    evaluation may yield values of any type.
    
  * BuildFileTest.assertPropertyUnset() fails with a slightly more 
    meaningful error message
    Bugzilla Report 48834
    
  * <junit> will now throw an exception if a test name is empty.  This
    used to manifest itself in unrelated errors like
    Bugzilla Report 43586.
 
  * A change that made <exec> more reliable on Windows (Bugzilla Report
    5003) strongly impacts the performance for commands that execute
    quickly, like attrib.  Basically no single execution of a command
    could take less than a second on Windows.
    A few timeouts have been tweaked to allow these commands to finish
    more quickly but still they will take longer than they did with Ant
    1.7.1.
    Bugzilla Report 48734.
 
  * Added SimpleBigProjectLogger, intermediate between NoBannerLogger and
    BigProjectLogger.
 
  * <mappedresources> supports new attributes enablemultiplemappings
    and cache.
 
  * Added the augment task to manipulate existing references via Ant's basic
    introspection mechanisms.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.8.0RC1 TO Ant 1.8.0
 ======================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
  * the appendtolines filter has been renamed to suffixlines.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
  * stack traces were not reported at all by <junit/>
    when filtertrace="on", which is the default.
 
  * ant.bat can now also process the -noclasspath switch when it is 
    the first switch on a command line.
    Bugzilla Report 48186.
 
  * <fixcrlf> now tries to delete the created temporary files earlier.
    Bugzilla Report 48506.
 
  * the implementation of <zip> had been changed in a way that broke
    the jarjar links task and protentially other third-party subclasses
    as well.
    Bugzilla Report 48541.
    
  * <scp> task didn't report build file location when a remote operation failed
    Bugzilla Report 48578.  
 
  * <propertyfile> would add the same comment and a date line each time
    it updated an existing property file.
    Bugzilla Report 48558.
 
  * <sound> didn't work properly in recent Java VMs.
    Bugzilla Report 48637.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 Changes from Ant 1.7.1 TO Ant 1.8.0RC1
 ======================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
  * if and unless attributes (on <target> as well as various tasks and other
    elements) have long permitted ${property} interpolation. Now, if the result
    evaluates to "true" or "false" (or "yes", "no", "on", "off"), that boolean
    value will be used; otherwise the traditional behavior of treating the value
    as a property name (defined ~ true, undefined ~ false) is used. Existing
    scripts could be broken if they perversely defined a property named "false"
    and expected if="false" to be true, or used if="true" expecting this to be
    triggered only if a property named "true" were defined.
 
  * Ant now requires Java 1.4 or later.
 
  * Improved handling of InterruptException (lets suppose someone/thing
    is trying to kill the thread when we receive an
    InterruptException), when an InterruptException is received, we do
    not wait anymore in a while loop till the end time has been
    reached.
    Bugzilla Report 42924.
 
  * Refactor PropertyHelper and introspection APIs to make extension
    more granular and support setting task/type attribute values to
    objects decoded by custom PropertyEvaluator delegates. Also add
    <propertyhelper> task for registering delegates and/or replacing
    the registered PropertyHelper instance.
    Bugzilla Report 42736.
 
  * Added a restricted form of typedef called <componentdef>. This
    allows definition of elements that can only be within tasks or
    types. This method is now used to define conditions, selectors,
    comparators and filterreaders. This means that tasks may now have
    nested conditions just by implementing the Condition interface,
    rather than extending ConditionBase. It also means that the use of
    namespaces for some of the selectors introduced in Ant 1.7.0 is no
    longer necessary.  Implementing this means that the DynamicElement
    work-around introduced in Ant 1.7.0 has been removed.
    Bugzilla Report 40511.
 
  * In the <touch> task when a <mapper> is used, the millis and
    datetime attributes now override the time of the source resource if
    provisioned.
    Bugzilla Report 43235.
 
  * Remove fall-back mechanism for references that are not resolved
    during normal runtime execution.
 
  * FileUtils.createTempFile now actually creates the file.
    The TempFile task still does not create the file by default, can be
    instructed to do so however using a new parameter.
    Bugzilla Report 33969.
   
  * A lock in Project ensured that a BuildListener's messageLogged
    method was only ever executed by a single thread at a time, while
    all other methods could be invoked by multiple threads
    simultaniously (while within <parallel>, for example).  This lock
    is no longer in place, messageLogged should be made thread-safe
    now.
 
  * <sql>'s onError="stop" no longer fails the build if an error
    occurs,  this is the main difference between stop and error and
    matches what the documentation implied.
    Bugzilla Report 24668.
 
  * Ant's configuration introspection mechanisms have been modified to prefer
    Resource and FileProvider attributes to plain java.io.File attributes;
    however the configuration-from-String behavior remains equivalent, rendering
    a FileResource.
 
  * CBZip2InputStream will now throw an IOException if
    passed in a null or empty InputStream to read from.
    Bugzilla Reports 32200.
 
  * <unzip> will now fail when trying to extract certain broken
    archives that would have been silently ignored in earlier version.
    Bugzilla Report 35000.
 
  * Ant's <zip> family of tasks tries to preserve the existing Unix
    permissions when updating archives or copying entries from one
    archive to another.
    Since not all archiving tools support storing Unix permissions in
    the same way that is used by Ant, sometimes the permissions read by
    Ant seem to be 0, which means nobody is allowed to do anything to
    the file or directory.
    If Ant now encounters a permission set of 0 it will assume that
    this is not the intended value and instead apply its own default
    values.  Ant used to create entries with 0 permissions itself.
    The <zip> family of tasks has a new attribute preserve0permissions
    that can be set to restore the old behavior.
    Bugzilla Report 42122.
 
  * If a batch containing multiple JUnit tests running inside a forked
    Java VM caused the VM to crash (or caused a timeout), the
    formatters would receive an error message for the last test in the
    batch.
    Ant will now pass in a test with the name "Batch-With-Multiple-Tests"
    instead - this is supposed to show more clearly that the last test
    may not have started at all.
    Bugzilla Report 45227.
 
  * If the number of minutes a build takes is bigger then 1000 Ant will
    no longer print a thousands separator in the "elapsed time"
    message.  It used to be the thousands separator of the current
    locale.
    Bugzilla Report 44659.
 
  * <symlink action="delete"> used to fail if the link was broken (i.e.
    pointing to a file or directory that no longer existed).  It will now
    silently try to remove the link.
    Bugzilla Report 41285.
 
  * <delete file="..."> used to log a warning and not delete broken
    symbolic links.  <delete dir="..."/> didn't even log a warning.
    The task will now try to delete them in both cases.
    Bugzilla Report 41285.
 
  * if the dir attribute of a <fileset> points to a symbolic link and
    followsymlinks is set to false, the fileset will no longer be
    scanned and always seem empty.
    Bugzilla Report 45741.
 
  * the .NET tasks that have been deprecated since Ant 1.7.0 have been
    removed, please use the stand-alone Antlib you can find at
    http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/dotnet/index.html
    instead.
 
  * the logic of closing streams connected to forked processes (read
    the input and output of <exec> and friends) has been changed to
    deal with cases where child processes of the forked processes live
    longer than their parents and keep Ant from exiting.
    It is unlikely but possible that the changed logic breaks stream
    handling on certain Java VMs.
    Bugzilla issue 5003.
 
  * <checksum>'s totalproperty was platform dependent because it relied
    on java.io.File#compareTo.  It has now been made platform
    independent, which means that totalPropery values obtained on
    Windows (and other systems where the sort order of File is not case
    sensitive) can be different from the values obtained with earlier
    versions of Ant.
    Bugzilla Report 36748.
 
  * globmapper didn't work properly if the "to" or "from" patterns
    didn't contain a "*".  In particular it implicitly added a * to the
    end of the pattern(s).  This is no longer the case.  If you relied
    on this behavior you will now need to explicitly specify the
    trailing "*".
    Bugzilla Report 46506.
 
  * <copy> silently ignored missing resources even with
    failOnError="true".  If your build tries to copy non-existant
    resources and you relied on this behavior you must now explicitly
    set failOnError to false.
    Bugzilla Report 47362.
 
  * Ant now prefers the java.runtime.version system property over
    java.vm.version for the Created-By Manifest attribute.
    Bugzilla Report 47632.
 
  * The <image> task now supports a nested mapper.  In order to
    implement this, the Java API of the task had to change so any
    custom subclass overriding the processFile method will need to
    adapt (by overriding the new two-arg processFile method).
    Bugzilla Report 23243.
 
  * A new property syntax can be used to set attributes from
    references: ${ant.ref:some-reference}
 
    In most cases this will yield the exact same result as 
    ${toString:some-reference} - only when an attribute setter method
    accepts an object type other than string and the project's
    reference is an Object of matching type the new syntax will pass in
    that object.
 
    If your build file already contains properties whose name starts
    with "ant.ref:" there is a potential for collision.  If your
    property has been set, normal property expansion will take
    precedence over the new syntax.  If the property has not been set
    and a reference with the postfix of your property name exists
    (i.e. in a very unlikely event) then the new syntax would yield a
    different result (an expanded property) than Ant 1.7.1 did.
 
  * A ProjectHelper implementation can now provide the default build file
    name it is expecting, and can specify if they can support a specific build
    file. So Ant is now capable of supporting several ProjectHelper
    implementations, deciding on which to use depending of the input build file.
 
  * Mapper-aware selectors (depends, different, present) now accept typedef'd
    FileNameMappers.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
  * The default logger was failing to print complete stack traces for
    exceptions other than BuildException when inside <ant> or
    <antcall>, thus omitting often important diagnostic
    information.
    Bugzilla 43398 (continued).
 
  * Better handling of package-info.class.
    Bugzilla Report 43114.
 
  * RPM task needed an inserted space between the define and the value.
    Bugzilla Report 46659.
 
  * Got rid of deadlock between in, out and err in the Redirector. 
    Bugzilla Report 44544.
 
  * Caused by AssertionError no longer filtered.
    Bugzilla Report 45631.
  
  * <zip> would sometimes recreate JARs unnecessarily.
    Bugzilla Report 45902.
 
  * <symlink> task couldn't overwrite existing symlinks that pointed to
    nonexistent files
    Bugzilla Report 38199.
 
  * <symlink> task couldn't overwrite files that were in the way of the symlink.
    Bugzilla Report 43426.
    
  * <symlink> task failonerror="false" does not stop build from failing
    when 'ln' command returns non-zero.
    Bugzilla Report 43624  
 
  * <touch> task couldn't differentiate between "no resources
    specified" and "no resources matched."
    Bugzilla Report 43799.
 
  * ManifestClassPath failed when a relative path would traverse the
    file system root.
    Bugzilla Report 44499.
 
  * <globmapper> had an indexoutofbounds when the prefix and postfix
    overlapped.
    Bugzilla Report 44731.
    
  * <typedef> and <taskdef> failed to accept file names with #
    characters in them.
    Bugzilla Report 45190
 
  * A deadlock could occur if a BuildListener tried to access an Ant property
    within messageLogged while a different thread also accessed one.
    Bugzilla Report 45194
 
  * Handle null result of system getProperty() in CommandlineJava.
    Similar to Bugzilla Report 42334.
 
  * Length task did not process nonexistent Resources even though these might
    conceivably still carry file length information.
    Bugzilla Report 45271.
 
  * <javac>'s includeJavaRuntime="false" should work for gcj now.  Note
    that you may need to set includeAntRuntime to false in order to

    attributes of the last merged manifest.
    Bugzilla Report 39655.
 
  * <delete> didn't work correctly with a <modified> selector because
    it was scanning the same filesets more than once.
    Bugzilla Report 43574.

    are instances or subclasses of FileResource.
    Bugzilla Report 43348
    
  * There is now a URLProvider interface for resources that act as a
    source of URLs. This should be used by tasks that require resources
    to provide URLs, rather than require that all resources are
    instances or subclasses of URLResource.
    
  * Fixcrlf now gives better error messages on bad directory attributes.
    Bugzilla Report 43936

    (the IDE, an <ant> task ...) when invoking the current project.
 
  * The <type> resource selector has had an "any" type added for better
    configurability.
 
  * Ant should detect the OS as both a Mac and a Unix system when
    running on OpenJDK.
    Bugzilla Report 44889.
 
  * new protected getConnection and getStatement methods allow
    subclasses of SQLExec more control - or access to the cached
    instances when overriding other methods like runStatements.
    Bugzilla Report 27178.
 
  * <sql> has a new failOnConnectionError attribute that can be used to
    keep a build going even if the task failed to connect to the
    database.
    Bugzilla Report 36712.
 
  * A new attribute strictDelimiterMatching can be used to ignore case
    or whitespace differences when <sql> searches for delimiters.
    This is useful if you execute a SQL script that has contains "GO"
    and "go" as delimiters.
    Bugzilla Report 26459.
 
  * A new showWarnings attribute of <sql> allows warnings to be logged.
    Bugzilla Report 41836.

    a build if a warning occurs.
    Bugzilla Report 41836.

    Bugzilla Report 39197.
 
  * <scp> can now preserve the file modification time when downloading
    files.
    Bugzilla Report 33939.
 
  * the new task sshsession can run multiple tasks in the presence of
    an SSH session providing (local and remote) tunnels.
    Bugzilla Report 43083.
 
  * ZipOutputStream has been sped up for certain usage scenarios that
    are not used by Ant's family of zip tasks.
    Bugzilla Report 45396.
 
  * <echo> supports an "output" Resource attribute as an alternative to "file".
 
  * <sql> "output" attribute now supports any Resource in addition to a file.
 
  * <scp> no longer requires a passphrase when using key based
    authentication.
    Bugzilla Report 33718.
 
  * a new failOnEmptyArchive attribute on <unzip> and <untar> can now

    archive.
 
  * <unzip> and <untar> have a new attribute stripAbsolutePathSpec.
    When set to true, Ant will remove any leading path separator from
    the archived entry's name before extracting it (making the name a
    relative file name).
    Bugzilla Report 28911.
 
  * <unzip> will now detect that it was asked to extract a file that is
    not an archive earlier if the file is big.

    resources to be selected by matching their names against a regular
    expression.

  * <echoxml> now supports XML namespaces.
    Bugzilla Report 36804.
 
  * A new listener for <junit> has been added that tries to invoke the
    tearDown method of a TestCase if that TestCase was run in a forked
    VM and the VM crashed or a timeout occured.  See the <junit> task's
    manual page for details.
    Bugzilla Report 37241.
 
  * The Jar task now supports the addition of a jar index file in update mode.
    Previously the absence of the index was not enough to trigger the rebuild;
    some other update was necessary.
    Bugzilla report 45098.
 
  * <ant> has a new attribute "useNativeBasedir" that makes the child
    build use the same basedir it would have used if invoked from the
    command line.  No matter what other attributes/properties have been
    set.
    Bugzilla Report 45711.

    Bugzilla Report 44772.
 
  * Antlib descriptors will now be parsed by the configured

  * <compositemapper>'s order of results is now predictable.
    Bugzilla Report 44873
 
  * a new <firstmatchmapper> has been added, which works similar to
    <compositemapper> but only returns the results of the first nested
    mapper that matches.
    Bugzilla Report 44873
 
  * <get> has a new maxtime attribute that terminates downloads that
    are taking too long.
    Bugzilla Report 45181.
 
  * <ftp> now supports selectors for remote directories as well.
    Bugzilla Report 44726.
 
  * In some cases Ant fails to rename files if the source or target
    file has just recently been closed on Windows.  It will now try to
    delete the offending file once again after giving the Java VM time
    to really close the file.
    Bugzilla Report 45960.
 
  * two new properties can be used to set the MIME-Type and charset
    used by MailLogger.
    Bugzilla Report 27211.
 
  * a new attribute of <mail> allows the task to succeed if it can
    reach at least one given recipient.
    Bugzilla Report 36446.

    environment variable CVS_PSERVER_PORT instead of the "official"
    CVS_CLIENT_PORT.
    Bugzilla Report 30124.
 
  * <cvsversion> now works for local repositories as well.
 
  * <cvstagdiff> has an option to ignore removed files now.
    Bugzilla Report 26257.
 
  * <cvs> and friends now support modules with spaces in their names
    via nested <module> elements.
 
  * A new attribute "ignoreEmpty" controls how <concat> deals when
    there are no resources to concatenate.  If it is set to false, the
    destination file will be created regardless, which reinstates the
