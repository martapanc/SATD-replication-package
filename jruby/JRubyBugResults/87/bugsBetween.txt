105217d348 RubyArray now obeys List.remove contract by removing only one element matching Object. Fix JRUBY-4661
56eeae1a85 Fix for JRUBY-4515: RubyArray doesn't have toJava method which makes JavaEmbedUtils.rubyToJava fail
0505fb1fc7 [1.9] Fix JRUBY-4508, add Array#rotate and Array#rotate!
aeef3e6d1d fixes JRUBY-4181: [1.8.7] Failures on 1.8.7 HEAD test/ruby/test_array. Failure 4.
ac54677333 fixes JRUBY-4175: RubySpec: Array#<=> returns nil when the argument is not array-like
4d034fafe1 Fix for JRUBY-4157: fannkuch and chameneosredux benchmarks timing out on The Benchmarks Game
6266374bc8 Fix for JRUBY-4053: ActiveRecord AssociationCollection#== method is returning false on equal results
7b201461f1 Fixes for JRUBY-3816: Objects returned from Java library call not fully unwrapped
2b6aedfc5d Fix for JRUBY-3878: String representation of arrays and symbols does not match ruby 1.9
397ae2d50e Fix JRUBY-3148
c6aebe391c Fix JRUBY-3612
219e0308de Fix for JRUBY-3387: Array#== rubyspec failure.
b3332e8a4b Fix for JRUBY-3251: ConcurrencyError bug when installing Merb on JRuby. Test pending.
04ce842cc4 Fixes for JRUBY-2883: Many Array methods don't handle recursive arrays properly, JRUBY-2878: Array#hash with recursive array crashes JRuby. Affected methods also match 1.9 behavior.
993f8c99ef A bunch of findbugs fixes from JRUBY-1173. Also renamed generated callbacks to be Callback in their name instead of Invoker, to distinguish from actual invokers.
a2854314c1 Fix for JRUBY-2065: Array#assoc and Array#rassoc are not COW aware.
bad1f67887 Fixes for JRUBY-1409, only alias the methods that MRI does; rebind others.
b395be2f73 Rewritten Enumerator class. This in turn fixes JRUBY-1265: Enumerable#each_slice (from enumerator) should splat values passed to block
238d169535 Fix for JRUBY-1209: Array#uniq, Array#|, Array#&, Array#- should be implemented in terms of RubyHash to actually use #eql? method on objects an array contains
875bdbab09 Fix for JRUBY-1210: Array#join behaves inconsistently on recursive arrays. This required some fixes to the inspection mechanism allowing the join to be efficient (e.g: not looking up a ThreadLoacal on ["foo","bar"].join)
e421186fd8 Fixes and tests for JRUBY-807, correct eql?/== behavior for hashes.
d77f8c9202 Fixes for JRUBY-361: supply a real binding to trace functions. Also fixes JRUBY-842 by short-circuiting STI methods so they trace instead of doing fast STI dispatch.
3cdb25eaa9 Fixes a bug, where frames are shared for blocks, which make define_method bonkers in certain situations. Also makes argument lists faster. Fixes JRUBY-520
7380355037 Fix for JRUBY-587. MRI YAML doesn't recognize floats with underscores in them, but we do, since that's in the standard. So I've removed that compliant behavior to be more like MRI. Also, the groundwork is in to have faster versions of some Array methods
