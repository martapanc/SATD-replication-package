87404f0e15 Fix JRUBY-6647
b9eefb9653 Fix JRUBY-5875: extending Struct and override initialize would make Marshal fail
c8522e573b Fix for JRUBY-2490, move allocation-related struct code into struct constructor.
f7bf2e0b56 Almost certainly a fix for JRUBY-1674, some other related issues, and some assertions to make sure it doesn't happen again.
368f8bf103 Fix for JRUBY-1598
95108e35e6 Fixes for JRUBY-1185, handle top-level visibility appropriately and use public visibility for module, class, and struct blocks.
a51846feee Fixes for JRUBY-1179, allow Struct.new(nil, ...) to create anonymous structs.
eb05ebdeb3 JRUBY-858: Eval within instance_eval seems to have the wrong self. JRUBY-866: struct and its use of metaclasses is not quite right (for inspect and ==) Previous two issues fix last test case in JRUBY-531
e421186fd8 Fixes and tests for JRUBY-807, correct eql?/== behavior for hashes.
6805fad9d5 Fix the remaining marshalling issues (for JRUBY-531). Two different failures about singleton classes, first one because we didn't properly generate a singleton-name for cases where the enclosing class/module was singleton. The second problem is that ENV should really be a singleton, and can't be dumped. The real fix for ENV is to generate it the same way as ARGF, but that means custom implementation of a whole lot of hash-methods, which doesn't seem to tempting right now. The quick fix is to make sure ENV is actually a singleton object anyway, done by adding the to_s method as a singleton method to it.
8c55ee5201 Fix for JRUBY-463. Make Struct.new on an existing struct name produce a warning, but also a new struct.
