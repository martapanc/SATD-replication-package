fe7d745ee8 Fix by Robert Dober for JRUBY-3599: loop does not rescue StopIteration in --1.9
99f983249e Rejigger how binding works with files and line numbers. It appears that we weren't tracking everything we needed in a binding. Instead of holding the current frame plus the current file+line, we held only the current frame. This led to us constantly setting and clearing the frame's line numbers in an attempt to get traces to line up. With binding carrying the original file+line, that juggling is no longer necessary. This fixes an eval spec and should improve backtraces across eval calls, which had numerous peculiarities before. This also fixes JRUBY-2328: Overriding require causes eval to give wrong __FILE__ in certain circumstances.
68ed5ba440 Fix for JRUBY-3011: java classes with non-public constructors are incorrectly instantiated
271c6d639b Fix for JRUBY-2252: Kernel#exec should not raise SystemExit
c7b80cf6bd Fix by Joseph LaFata for JRUBY-3298: Kernel.srand calls #to_i on number
0203775151 Fixes for JRUBY-2834: More than 50 RubySpec failures for ARGF
fad3700407 Fix for JRUBY-3131, make "self" in a binding from "send :binding" be the object sent to. Also split 1.8 and 1.9 behavior for now; my vote is that this should be unspecified behavior.
c6090c807d Partial fix for JRUBY-1551; original reported case passes but one case in the provided unit test still fails.
8829a85eec Fix JRUBY-3066 by implementing __method__ and __callee__ for Ruby1.9 compatibility.
4056e6829a Fix for JRUBY-2729. No test provided, because I'm a big slacker. Maybe in a moment.
793296a577 Fix for JRUBY-2605, make explicit bindings use the same logic as implicit eval bindings, so they get frame's block correctly.
2a9dbe56c4 Fixing JRUBY-2041 by removing the old "loop break" logic and doing a simpler jump target test. This passes all tests and everything runs, so I believe the "loop break" logic was probably a workaround for an incorrectly-implemented loop. Optimistically going ahead with this change.
07c9985d07 Modify Kernel#exit! to throw a Java MainExitException instead of a Ruby-catchable SystemExitException. Fixes JRUBY-2363 (I hope).
982486857d Fixes to allow exec'ed in-process subprocesses work more cleanly wrt stdio, by allowing the "parent" processes's normal Java IO stdio streams to be used directly in the "child" process. JRUBY-2156 and JRUBY-2154.
a1ed6bb05e Fix for JRUBY-1455 - reimplement ARGF to be a regular singleton Object instance with singleton methods. This allows cloning to work correctly.
