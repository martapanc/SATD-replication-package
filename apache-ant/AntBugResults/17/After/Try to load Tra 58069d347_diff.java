 Changes from Ant 1.7.x TO current SVN version
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * Ant now requires Java 1.4 or later.
 
 * Improved handling of InterruptException (lets suppose someone/thing is
   trying to kill the thread when we receive an InterruptException),
   when an InterruptException is received, we do not wait anymore in a while
   loop till the end time has been reached. Bugzilla report 42924.
 
 * Refactor PropertyHelper and introspection APIs to make extension more
   granular and support setting task/type attribute values to objects
   decoded by custom PropertyEvaluator delegates. Also add <propertyhelper>
   task for registering delegates and/or replacing the registered PropertyHelper
   instance.  Bugzilla report 42736.
 
 * Added a restricted form of typedef called <componentdef>. This allows
   definition of elements that can only be within tasks or types. This
   method is now used to define conditions, selectors and selectors. This
   means that tasks may now have nested conditions just by implementing
   the Condition interface, rather than extending ConditionBase. It also
   means that the use of namespaces for some of the selectors introduced
   in Ant 1.7.0 is no longer necessary.
   Implementing this means that the DynamicElement work-around introduced
   in Ant 1.7.0 has been removed.
   Bugzilla report 40511.
 
 * In the <touch> task when a <mapper> is used, the millis and datetime
   attributes now override the time of the source resource if provisioned. 
   Bugzilla report 43235.
 
 * Remove fall-back mechanism for references that are not resolved
   during normal runtime execution.
 
 * FileUtils.createTempFile now actually creates the file.
   The TempFile task still does not create the file by default, can be instructed
   to do so however using a new parameter.
   Bugzilla report 33969.
   
 * A lock in Project ensured that a BuildListener's messageLogged
   method was only ever executed by a single thread at a time, while
   all other methods could be invoked by multiple threads
   simultaniously (while within <parallel>, for example).  This lock is
   no longer in place, messageLogged should be made thread-safe now.
 
  * <sql>'s onError="stop" no longer fails the build if an error
    occurs,  this is the main difference between stop and error and
    matches what the documentation implied.
    Bugzilla Report 24668.
 
  * Ant's configuration introspection mechanisms have been modified to prefer
    Resource and FileProvider attributes to plain java.io.File attributes;
    however the configuration-from-String behavior remains equivalent, rendering
    a FileResource.
 
  * CBZip2InputStream will now throw an IOException if
    passed in a null or empty InputStream to read from.
    Bugzilla Reports 32200.
 
  * <unzip> will now fail when trying to extract certain broken
    archives that would have been silently ignored in earlier version.
    Bugzilla report 35000.
 
  * Ant's <zip> family of tasks tries to preserve the existing Unix
    permissions when updating archives or copying entries from one
    archive to another.
    Since not all archiving tools support storing Unix permissions in
    the same way that is used by Ant, sometimes the permissions read by
    Ant seem to be 0, which means nobody is allowed to do anything to
    the file or directory.
    If Ant now encounters a permission set of 0 it will assume that
    this is not the intended value and instead apply its own default
    values.  Ant used to create entries with 0 permissions itself.
    The <zip> family of tasks has a new attribute preserve0permissions
    that can be set to restore the old behavior.
    Bugzilla Report 42122.
 
  * If a batch containing multiple JUnit tests running inside a forked
    Java VM caused the VM to crash (or caused a timeout), the
    formatters would receive an error message for the last test in the
    batch.
    Ant will now pass in a test with the name "Batch-With-Multiple-Tests"
    instead - this is supposed to show more clearly that the last test
    may not have started at all.
    Bugzilla Report 45227.
 
  * If the number of minutes a build takes is bigger then 1000 Ant will
    no longer print a thousands separator in the "elapsed time"
    message.  It used to be the thousands separator of the current
    locale.
    Bugzilla Report 44659.
 
  * <symlink action="delete"> used to fail if the link was broken (i.e.
    pointing to a file or directory that no longer existed).  It will now
    silently try to remove the link.
    Bugzilla Report 41285.
 
  * <delete file="..."> used to log a warning and not delete broken
    symbolic links.  <delete dir="..."/> didn't even log a warning.
    The task will now try to delete them in both cases.
    Bugzilla Report 41285.
 
  * if the dir attribute of a <fileset> point to a symbolic link and
    followsymlinks is set to false, the fileset will no longer be
    scanned and always seem empty.
    Bugzilla Report 45741.
 
  * the .NET tasks that have been deprecated since Ant 1.7.0 have been
    removed, please use the stand-alone Antlib you can find at
    http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/dotnet/index.html
    instead.
 
  * the logic of closing streams connected to forked processes (read
    the input and output of <exec> and friends) has been changed to
    deal with cases where child processes of the forked processes live
    longer than their parents and keep Ant from exiting.
    It is unlikely but possible that the changed logic breaks stream
    handling on certain Java VMs.
    Bugzilla issue 5003.

  * when checking whether a jar is signed, <signjar> ignored the
    sigfile attribute.
    Bugzilla Report 44805.
 
  * When using JavaMail all <mail> tasks used the same mail host

+   using TraX) before falling back to Ant's own classpath.
+   Bugzilla Report 46172.
+
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
  * There is now a FileProvider interface for resources that act as a source
    of filenames. This should be used by tasks that require resources
    to provide filenames, rather than require that all resources
    are instances or subclasses of FileResource.
    Bugzilla report 43348
    
  * Fixcrlf now gives better error messages on bad directory attributes.
    Bugzilla report 43936
    
  * a new property ant.project.default-target holds the value of the
    current <project>'s default attribute.
 
  * a new property ant.project.invoked-targets holds a comma separated
    list of the targets that have been specified on the command line
    (the IDE, an <ant> task ...) when invoking the current project.
 
  * The <type> resource selector has had an "any" type added for better
    configurability.
 
  * Ant should detect the OS as both a Mac and a Unix system when
    running on OpenJDK.
    Bugzilla Report 44889.
 
  * new protected getConnection and getStatement methods allow
    subclasses of SQLExec more control - or access to the cached
    instances when overriding other methods like runStatements.
    Bugzilla Report 27178.
 
  * <sql> has a new failOnConnectionError attribute that can be used to
    keep a build going even if the task failed to connect to the
    database.
    Bugzilla Report 36712.
 
  * A new attribute strictDelimiterMatching can be used to ignore case
    or whitespace differences when <sql> searches for delimiters.
    This is useful if you execute a SQL script that has contains "GO"
    and "go" as delimiters.
    Bugzilla Report 26459.
 
  * A new showWarnings attribute of <sql> allows warnings to be logged.
    Bugzilla Report 41836.
 
  * A new treatWarningsAsErrors attribute of <sql> can be used to fail
    a build if a warning occurs.
    Bugzilla Report 41836.
 
  * Ant now supports scoped properties (see Local task). Bugzilla report 23942.
 
  * <sql>'s CSV output can be controlled via the new attributes
    csvColumnSeparator and csvQuoteCharacter.
    Bugzilla report 35627.
 
  * <ftp>'s logging has been improved.
    Bugzilla reports 30932, 31743.
 
  * It is now possible to disable <ftp>'s remote verification.
    Bugzilla report 35471.
 
  * <sshexec> now supports input in a way similar to <exec>
    Bugzilla report 39197.
 
  * <scp> can now preserve the file modification time when downloading
    files.
    Bugzilla Issue 33939.
 
  * the new task sshsession can run multiple tasks in the presence of
    an SSH session providing (local and remote) tunnels.
    Bugzilla Issue 43083.
 
  * ZipOutputStream has been sped up for certain usage scenarios that
    are not used by Ant's family of zip tasks.
    Bugzilla report 45396.
 
  * <echo> supports an "output" Resource attribute as an alternative to "file".
 
  * <sql> "output" attribute now supports any Resource in addition to a file.
 
  * <scp> no longer requires a passphrase when using key based
    authentication.
    Bugzilla report 33718.
 
  * a new failOnEmptyArchive attribute on <unzip> and <untar> can now
    make the task fail the build if it tries to extract an empty
    archive.
 
  * <unzip> and <untar> have a new attribute stripAbsolutePathSpec.
    When set to true, Ant will remove any leading path separator from
    the archived entry's name before extracting it (making the name a
    relative file name).
    Bugzilla Report 28911.
 
  * <unzip> will now detect that it was asked to extract a file that is
    not an archive earlier if the file is big.
    Bugzilla Report 45463.
 
  * New file and resource selectors <readable/> and <writable/> have
    been added that select file which the current process can read or
    write.
    Bugzilla Report 45081.
 
  * The filename file selector has a new attribute regex that allows
    files to be selected by matching their names against a regular
    expression.
    Bugzilla Report 45284
 
  * The name resource selector has a new attribute regex that allows
    resources to be selected by matching their names against a regular
    expression.
    Bugzilla Report 45284
 
  * Enhanced performance of Project.fireMessageLoggedEvent and DirectoryScanner 
    Bugzilla Report 45651 & 45665
 
  * The package list location for offline links can now be specified as
    an URL.
    Bugzilla Report 28881
 
  * <echoxml> now supports XML namespaces.
    Bugzilla Report 36804.
 
  * A new listener for <junit> has been added that tries to invoke the
    tearDown method of a TestCase if that TestCase was run in a forked
    VM and the VM crashed or a timeout occured.  See the <junit> task's
    manual page for details.
    Bugzilla Report 37241.
 
  * The Jar task now supports the addition of a jar index file in update mode.
    Previously the absence of the index was not enough to trigger the rebuild;
    some other update was necessary.  Bugzilla report 45098.
 
  * <ant> has a new attribute "useNativeBasedir" that makes the child
    build use the same basedir it would have used if invoked from the
    command line.  No matter what other attributes/properties have been
    set.
    Bugzilla Report 45711.
 
  * <patch> has a new optional failOnError attribute.
    Bugzilla Report 44772.
 
  * Antlib descriptors will now be parsed by the configured
    ProjectHelper if the implementation overrides the new
    canParseAntlibDescriptor and parseAntlibDescriptor methods.  If the
    configured helper doesn't override the methods, a new instance of
    ProjectHelper2 will be used just like in ant 1.7.1.
    Bugzilla Report 42208.
 
  * It is now possible to explicitly set the executable used by
    <signjar>.
    Bugzilla Report 39189.
 
  * <compositemapper>'s order of results is now predictable.
    Bugzilla Report 44873
 
  * a new <firstmatchmapper> has been added, which works similar to
    <compositemapper> but only returns the results of the first nested
    mapper that matches.
    Bugzilla Report 44873
 
  * <get> has a new maxtime attribute that terminates downloads that
    are taking too long.
    Bugzilla Report 45181.
 
  * <ftp> now supports selectors for remote directories as well.
    Bugzilla Report 44726.
 
  * In some cases Ant fails to rename files if the source or target
    file has just recently been closed on Windows.  It will now try to
    delete the offending file once again after giving the Java VM time
    to really close the file.
    Bugzilla Report 45960.
 
  * two new properties can be used to set the MIME-Type and charset
    used by MailLogger.
    Bugzilla Report 27211.
 
  * a new attribute of <mail> allows the task to succeed if it can
    reach at least one given recipient.
    Bugzilla Report 36446.
 
  * two new properties allow MailLogger to send a fixed text instead of
    the log file.
    Bugzilla Report 38029.
 
  * <cvsversion> is supposed to support CVSNT now.
    Bugzilla Report 31409.
 
  * <cvs>' port attribute should now work for all clients that use the
    environment variable CVS_PSERVER_PORT instead of the "official"
    CVS_CLIENT_PORT.
    Bugzilla Report 30124.
 
  * <cvsversion> now works for local repositories as well.
 
  * <cvstagdiff> has an option to ignore removed files now.
    Bugzilla Report 26257.
 
  * <cvs> and friends now support modules with spaces in their names
    via nested <module> elements.
 
  * A new attribute "ignoreEmpty" controls how <concat> deals when
    there are no resources to concatenate.  If it is set to false, the
    destination file will be created regardless, which reinstates the
    behavior of Ant 1.7.0.
    Bugzilla Report 46010.
 
  * If the new remote attribute is set to true, <cvschangelog> can now
    work against a remote repository without any working copy.
    Bugzilla Report 27419.
 
  * start and end tags can now be used instead of dates in
    <cvschangelog>.
    Bugzilla Report 27419.
 
  * MailLogger and <mail> can now optionally enable support for
    STARTTLS.
    Bugzilla Report 46063.
 
  * <import> has new attributes "as" and "prefixSeparator" that can be
    used to control the prefix prepended to the imported target's
    names.
 
  * a new task <include> provides an alternative to <import> that
    should be preferred when you don't want to override any targets.
 
  * delete has a new attribute removeNotFollowedSymlink.  If set to
    true, symbolic links not followed (because followSymlinks was false
    or the number of symlinks was too big) will be removed.
    Bugzilla Report 36658.
 
  * the os and osfamily attributes of <chown>, <chgrp>, <chmod> and
    <attrib> can now be used to run the commands on operating systems
    other than their "native" environment, i.e. non-Unix or non-Windows
    operating systems repsectively.
    Bugzilla Report 7624.
 
  * a new resource collection <mappedresources> generalizes the prefix
    and fullpath attributes of <zipfileset> to arbitrary mappers that
    can be applied to arbitrary resource collections.
    Bugzilla Report 4240.
 
  * <tarfileset> and <zipfileset> have a new attribute
    errorOnMissingArchive that allows "optional" filesets that don't
    break the build if the archive doesn't exist.
    Bugzilla Report 46091.
 
  * <javadoc> has new attributes that correspond to the
    -docfilessubdirs and -excludedocfilessubdir command line arguments.
    Bugzilla Report 34455.
 
  * <xslt> now fails early if a specified stylesheet doesn't exist.
    Bugzilla Report 34525.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.7.0 TO Ant 1.7.1
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * String resources only have properties single expanded. If you relied on
   <string> resources being expanded more than once, it no longer happens.
   Bugzilla report 42277.
 
 * A String resource's encoding attribute was only taken into account when
   set from the resource's OutputStream; the InputStream provided the String's
   binary content according to the platform's default encoding. Behavior has
   been modified to encode outgoing (InputStream) content as well as encoding
   incoming (OutputStream) content.
 
 * <java> with fork now returns gives -1 instead of 0 as result when failonerror
   is false and some exception (including timeout) occurs. Br 42377. 
 
 * ant-type attribute has been marked as deprecated and a warning has been
   issued if it is encountered in the build file.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * The default logger was failing to print complete stack traces for exceptions
   other than BuildException, thus omitting often important diagnostic
   information. Bugzilla 43398.
 
 * Error in FTP task
   Bugzilla report 41724
 
 * Regression: Locator fails with URI encoding problem when spaces in path
   Bugzilla report 42222

   message "URI has authority component" appears
   Bugzilla report 42275
 
 * Improvements in AntClassLoader Speed.
   Bugzilla report 42259
 
 * Error in handling of some permissions, most notably the AllPermission on
   jdk 1.5
   Bugzilla report 41776
 
 * Replace task summary output incorrect.
   Bugzilla report 41544
 
 * Dependset crashes ant when timestamp on files change during Dependset
   execution.
   Bugzilla report 41284
 
 * Bug in org.apache.tools.ant.types.resources.comparators.Date
   Bugzilla report 41411
 
 * <junit> in Ant 1.7.0 could throw NPE if no <classpath> was defined.
   Bugzilla report 41422.
 
 * In Ant 1.7.0, <fileset> in <javadoc> does not by default include only
   **/*.java as the documentation claims and earlier revisions did.
   Bugzilla report 41264.
 
 * SPI support in jar was broken.
   Bugzilla report 41201.
   
 * jsch-0.1.30 causes SCP task to hang
   Bugzilla report 41090.
 
 * Target from imported file listed twice in projecthelp.
   Bugzilla report 41226.
 
 * <sql> task double-expands properties if expandproperties is true,
   and expands properties if expandproperties is false.
   Bugzilla report 41204.
 
 * Rolling back Bugzilla 32927 (set a default description for a javadoc tag
   if not set) as it caused a BC problem.
   Bugzilla report 41268.
 
 * <apt> forks properly and so memory settings are picked up.
   Bug report 41280.
 
 * Regression: NPE was thrown when using <pathconvert> against a
   (third-party instantiated) fileset with null Project reference.
 
 * Strip out all -J arguments to non forking rmic adapters, specifically
   the Sun and Weblogic compilers.
   Bug report 41349
 
 * Synchonization issues in PropertyHelper.  Bugzilla 41353.
 
 * <concat binary="true" append="true"> did not append.  Bugzilla 41399.
  
 * -autoproxy turns Java1.5+ automatic proxy support on. Bugzilla 41904
 
 * Handle null result of system getProperty(). Bugzilla 42334.
 
 * Regression: concat fixlastline="true" should not have applied to
   nested text, but did in Ant 1.7.0. Bugzilla 42369.
 
 * Regression: ant.version was not passed down in <ant>, <subant>.
   This worked in Ant 1.6.5, but not in 1.7.0.
   ant.core.lib (added in 1.7.0) was also not being propagated.
   Bugzilla bug 42263
 
 * Regression: bzip2 task created corrupted output files for some inputs.
   Bugzilla bug 41596.

   Bugzilla 42739.
 
 * Modified selector doesn't update the cache if only one file has changed.
   Bugzilla 42802.
 
 * Regression: Path subclasses that overrode list() stopped working in
   resourceCollection contexts in Ant 1.7.0. Bugzilla 42967.
 
 * <property> supports loading from xml based property definition.
   Bugzilla 42946
 
 * <junit> supports collecting and rerunning failed test cases
   (textXXX methods). Bugzilla 42984.  
 
 * War task failed with "No WEB-INF/web.xml file was added" when called
   a second time. Bugzilla 43121.
 
 * FilterMapper could throw an NPE.
   Bugzilla 43292.
 
 * Regession nested macrodefs with elements could cause StackOverFlow.
   Bugzilla 43324.
 
 * Some changes to <junit> broke third party tasks that extend it (like
   Apache Cactus' Ant task).  The changes have been modified so that
   subclases should now work again - without any changes to the
   subclass.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Various small optimizations speed up common tasks such as <javac> on large
   filesets, reducing both I/O and CPU usage.
 
 * Profiling logger has been added with basic profiling capabilities.
 
 * <script> now has basic support for JavaFX scripts
 
 * SSH task can now take a command parameter containing the commands to execute.
   This allows you to connect to a server and execute a number of commands
   without constantly reconnecting for each command.
 
 * Upgraded XML API to XML commons version 1.3.04.
 
 * Upgraded to Xerces 2.9.0

   Bugzilla 29143
 
 * Allow <mapper refid> to refer directly to a FileNameMapper instance.
 
 * If you try and use a type in a namespace (or an antlib), and the type is not
   recognized but there are other definitions in that namespace, Ant lists what
   the known definitions are. This helps you find spelling errors.
 
 * Add a <last> resource collection, corresponding to <first>.
 
 * Add new <truncate> task.
 
 * <junitreport> xsl stylesheets allow setting the title used in <title> and <h1> tags by
   using <report><param> element.  Bugzilla 41742.
 
 * Add IgnoreDependenciesExecutor for weird cases when the user wants to run
   only the targets explicitly specified.
 
 * Patternset allows nested inverted patternsets using <invert>.
 
 * <manifest> checks for validity of attribute names.
 
 * JUnitVersionHelper.getTestCaseClassName is now public. Bugzilla 42231
 
 * <string> resource supports nested text. Bugzilla bug 42276
 
 * <scriptdef> now sources scripts from nested resources/resource collections. This lets you
   define scripts in JARs, remote URLs, or any other supported resource. Bugzilla report 41597.
 
 * <concat> is now usable as a single-element ResourceCollection.
 
 * It is now possible to provide the value of a <striplinecomments> filter's
   <comment> nested element as nested text instead of using the 'value'
   attribute.

   Bugzilla 40776.
 
 * <fileset> has a new attribute - errorOnMissingDir.
   Bugzilla 11270.
 
 * <javac> handles package-info.java files, there were repeatedly compiled.
   Bugzilla 43114.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.6.5 to Ant 1.7.0
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 -------------------------------------------
 
 * Initial support for JDK 6 (JSR 223) scripting.
   <*script*> tasks will now use javax.scripting if BSF is
   not available, or if explicitly requested by using
   a "manager" attribute.
 
 * Removed launcher classes from nodeps jar.
 
 * <classconstants> filter reader uses ISO-8859-1 encoding to read
   the java class file. Bugzilla report 33604.
 
 * Defer reference process. Bugzilla 36955, 34458, 37688.
   This may break build files in which a reference was set in a target which was
   never executed. Historically, Ant would set the reference early on, during parse
   time, so the datatype would be defined. Now it requires the reference to have
   been in a bit of the build file which was actually executed. If you get
   an error about an undefined reference, locate the reference and move it somewhere
   where it is used, or fix the depends attribute of the target in question to
   depend on the target which defines the reference/datatype.
   As a result of testing on real live build scripts, a fall-back mechanism
   was put it place to allow references that are out-of-band to be resolved. If
   this happens a big warning message is logged. This fall-back mechanism will
   be removed in Ant 1.8.0.
 
 * <script> and <scriptdef> now set the current thread context.
 
 * Unrestrict the dbvendor names in the websphere element of the ejbjar task.
   Bugzilla Report 40475.
 
 * <env> nested element in <java>, <exec> and others is now case-insensitive
   for windows OS. Bugzilla Report 28874.
 
 * Removed support for xalan1 completely. Users of Xalan1 for Ant builds will
   have to stay at ant 1.6.5 or upgrade to xalan2.
 
 * Use org.apache.log4j.Logger instead of org.apache.log4j.Category.
   Category has been deprecated for ~2 years and has been removed from
   the log4j code.  Logger was introduced in log4j 1.2 so users of
   log4j 1.1 and log4j 1.0 need to upgrade to a newer version of log4j.
   Bugzilla Report 31951.
 
 * build.sysclasspath now also affects the bootclasspath handling of
   spawned Java VMs.  If you set build.sysclasspath to anything other
   than "ignore" (or leave it unset, since "ignore" is the default when
   it comes to bootclasspath handling), then the bootclasspath of the
   VM running Ant will be added to the bootclasspath you've specified.
 
 * The <java fork="false"> now as per default installs a security manager
   using the default permissions. This is now independent of the
   failonerror attribute.  Bugzilla report 33361.
 
 * <signjar> now notices when the jar and signedjar are equal, and switches
   to the same dependency logic as when signedjar is omitted. This may break
   something that depended upon signing in this situation. However, since
   invoking the JDK jarsigner program with -signedjar set to the source jar
   actually crashes the JVM on our (Java1.5) systems, we don't think any
   build files which actually worked will be affected by the change.
 
 * <signjar> used to ignore a nested fileset when a jar was also provided as an
   attribute, printing a warning message; now it signs files in the fileset.
 
 * An improved method of handling timestamp granularity differences between
   client and server was added to the <ftp> task.  FTP servers typically
   have HH:mm timestamps whereas local filesystems have HH:mm:ss timestamps.
   Previously, this required tweaking with the timediffmillis attribute
   which also was used to handle timezone differences.  Now, there is a new
   timestampgranularity attribute.  The default value for get operations is 0
   since the user has the more powerful preservelastmodified attribute to work
   with.  Since this is not available on put operations the default value
   adds a minute to the server timestamp in order to account for this,
   Scripts which previously used timediffmillis to do this compensation may
   need to be rewritten.  timediffmillis has now been deprecated.
 
 * Support for the XSL:P XML parser has been removed.
   Bugzilla Report 23455.
 
 * Visual Age for Java optional tasks removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * Testlet (test) optional task removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * IContract optional task removed as the required library is no
   longer available.
 
 * Metamata (maudit, mmetrics, and mparse tasks) removed as the required 
   library is no longer available.
 
 * Sitraka (jpcoverage, jpcovmerge, jpcovreport) tasks suppressed as the 
   required library is no longer available.
 
 * <fixcrlf> used \r (Mac) line endings on OS X, whose proper line separator
   is \n (Unix).  Bugzilla report 39585.
 
 * <scp> now optionally supports the sftp protocol, you may need a
   newer jsch.jar.  Bugzilla Report 39373.
 
 * Ant launcher program prints errors to stderr, and exits with a 2 exit code
   value if, for any reason, it cannot actually start Ant proper. This will only
   affect programs/scripts that called the launcher and which did not want to
   receive an error if Ant itself would not start
 
 * All .NET tasks are now deprecated in favor of the new .NET Antlib:
   http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/dotnet/index.html

   not e.g. pick up files that didn't exist the first time through.
   Bugzilla 41151.
 
 * OOM caused by IH holding on to classes and thus their classloaders.
   Bugzilla 28283 and 33061.

   Bugzilla report 32884.
 
 * ant.bat now looks in %USERPROFILE% and %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in addition to
   %HOME% for pre/post batch files. Bugzilla report 39298.
 
 * The inheritance hierarchy of the legacy <path> type was changed; code built
   against Ant 1.7 would therefore no longer execute on older versions of Ant.
   Since <path> is historically heavily used this was undesirable, and since it
   is also avoidable, the change to <path>'s taxonomy was reverted.

 * Invalid hash code of Target causes XmlLogger to fail.
   Bugzilla report 40207.

 * <available> searched parent directories for files.
   Bugzilla report 37148.

 * DemuxOutputStream now uses a WeakHashMap to store the thread-stream mapping,
   to avoid holding on to thread references after they terminate.
 
 * <xmlvalidate> and <schemavalidate> create a new parser for every file in a
   fileset, and so validate multiple files properly. Bugzilla Report 32791.

   domain.  Bugzilla 38082.
 
 * If the class invoked by the <java> task threw a ClassNotFoundException,
   this was misinterpreted as the specified class itself not being found.
 
 * <echoproperties> setPrefix javadoc claimed null or empty prefix would be
   ignored; instead an error was thrown.  Bugzilla report 39954.
 
 * <get> would fetch files that were up to date, because it used > in a
   remote/local timestamp comparison, not >=. Bugzilla 35607.
 
 * <xslt> passes the current file (name + directory) to the
   stylesheet/transformation.  xsl-parameter name is configurable.
   Bugzilla report 21042.
 
 * The <zip> API allowed creation of directories in file-only archives; a
   habitual offender was the subclassed <jar>, which included META-INF/ in
   the destination file regardless of whether filesonly was set to true.
 
 * <rmic> has a new adapter, xnew, to use the -XNew back end on java1.5+.
   By forking rmic, this works on java1.6+. Bugzilla report 38732.

   Bugzilla report 40238.
 
 * Mixing of add and addConfigured methods in Mapper/ChainedMapper
   causes incorrect chaining. Bugzilla report 40228.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Warn user when a reference in the form "${refid}" cannot be resolved as this
   is a sign they probably meant "refid" (misuse of property expansion syntax).
 
 * Add dtd to javadoc for junit.
   Bugzilla 40754.
 
 * Add quiet attribute to loadfile/resource.
   Bugzilla 38249.
 
 * Make Locator#fromURI also append the drive letter when running under Windows
   with JDK 1.3 or 1.2.
 
 * Do not uppercase the drive letters systematically in FileUtils#normalize.
 
 * Java 5 enumerations may now be used as values in XML attributes in place of
   EnumeratedAttribute. Bugzilla 41058.
 
 * Create a pom file for ant-testutil and add ant-testutil.jar to the ant
   distribution. Bugzilla 40980.
 
 * Roll back automatic proxy enabling on Java 1.5. It broke things like
   Oracle JDBC drivers, and Ant itself on IBM's JVM on AIX, and didnt
   seem to work to well the rest of the time.
   To enable the feature, use the -autoproxy command line option.
 
 * Upgraded XML API and parser to Xerces 2.8.1
 
 * A code review of some threaded logic has tightened up the synchronization
   of Watchdog, ExecuteWatchdog and ExecuteJava, which could reduce the occurence
   of race conditions here, especially on Java1.5+.
 
 * Allow broken reference build files. The defer reference processing would
   break too many files - so allow them with a warning.
 
 * Removed dependency on sun.misc.UUEncoder for UUMailer.
 
 * Added regex attribute to the echoproperties task.
   Bugzilla 40019.
 
 * <war> task now allows you to omit the web.xml file. as this is optional
   in the servlet 2.5 and Java EE 5 APIs. set needxmlfile="false" to
   avoid a missing web.xml file from halting the build.
 
 * Diagnostics catches and logs security exceptions when accessing system properties.
 
 * <javadoc> useexternalfile now applies to all command line arguments
   of javadoc. Bugzilla report 40852.

   not specified. Bugzill report 32927.
 
 * Some performance improvements, including Bugzilla report 25778.
 
 * Add <matches> condition. Bugzilla report 28883.
 
 * Extending JAR-Task for SPI. Bugzilla report 31520.

   resources from other resources' content. Inspired by Bugzilla 40504.
 
 * Added <compare> resource selector to select resources based on the
   results of their comparison to other resources.
 
 * Added outputtoformatters attribute to <junit> to allow suppression
   of noisey tests. Bugzilla report 12817.
 
 * Log level of message 'Overriding previous definition of reference to'
   set to Verbose. Bugzilla report 17240.
 
 * Added setbeans attribute to <script> to allow <script>'s to be
   run without referencing all references.
   Bugzilla report 37688.
 
 * Added classpath attribute and nested element to <script> to allow
   the language jars to be specified in the build script.
   Bugzilla report 29676.
 
 * Trim the driver attribute on the <sql> task. Bugzilla report 21228.
 
 * Allow (jar) files as well as directories to be given to jdepend.
   Bugzilla report 28865.

   Bugzilla report 36772.
 
 * Added searchparents attribute to <available>. Bugzilla report 39549.
 
 * Tasks that don't extend Ant's Task class will now get the build file
   location reflected into a method of the signature void setLocation(Location)
   - if such a method exists.
 
 * Remove needless synchronization in DirectoryScanner.
   Bugzilla report 40237.
 
 * Improved recursion detection for lines with multiple matches of same token
   on a single line.  Bugzilla report 38456.
 
 * Task will now log correctly even if no project is set.
   Bugzilla report 38458.
 
 * Use alternative names for the command line arguments in javac. Bugzilla
   Report 37546.
