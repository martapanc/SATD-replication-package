 Changes from current Ant 1.6 CVS version to current CVS version
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * Translate task does not remove tokens when a key is not found.
   It logs a verbose message.  Bugzilla Report 13936.
 
 * <whichresource> failed to load classes correctly.
 
 * Redirector exhibited inconsistent behavior with regard to split
   output.  When sent to file only, files would be created in all
   cases; when split file-property, files were only created if
   writes were performed.
 
 * replacestring tokenfilter only replaced the first occurrence.
 
 * AntLikeTasksAtTopLevelTest failed on cygwin.
 
 * <junit> and <assertions> are working together. Bugzilla report 27218
 
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Enable to choose the regexp implementation without system property.
   Bugzilla Report 15390.
 
 * <nice> task lets you set the priority of the current thread; non-forking
   <java> code will inherit this priority in their main thread.
 
 * <touch> has filelist support.
 
 * A new roundup attribute on <zip> and related task can be used to
   control whether the file modification times inside the archive will
   be rounded up or down (since zips only store modification times with
   a granularity of two seconds).  The default remains to round up.
   Bugzilla Report 17934.
 
 * Nested file mappers and a container mapper implementation have been
   introduced.  Additionally, the <mapper> element now accepts "defined"
   nested FileNameMapper implementations directly, allowing a usage
   comparable to those of <condition>, <filter>, and <selector>.
 
 * New attribute "negate" on <propertyset> to invert selection criteria.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.6.1 to current Ant 1.6 CVS version
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 Fixed bugs:

   using a nested <filelist>.  Bugzilla Report 26985.
 
 * tagdiff.xml was broken in ant 1.6.1. Bugzilla Report 27057.
 
 * if the basedir contained .. or . dirs, and the build file name contained
   .. or ., the basedir was set incorrectly. Bugzilla Report 26765.
 
 * regression from ant 1.5, exec task outputted two redundant trailing newlines.
   Bugzilla Report 27546.
 
 * NPE when running commons listener. Bugzilla Report 27373.
 
 * <java> swallowed the stack trace of exceptions thrown by the
   executed program if run in the same VM.
 
 * -projecthelp swallowed (configuration) errors silently.
   Bugzilla report 27732.
 
+* filterset used by filtertask doesn't respect loglevel. Bugzilla Report 27568.
+
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Docs fixes for xmlvalidate.html, javadoc.html, starteam.
   Bugzilla Reports 27092, 27284, 27554.
 
 * <pathconvert> now accepts nested <mapper>s.  Bugzilla Report 26364.

 Changes from Ant 1.6.0 to Ant 1.6.1
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 * License is now Apache Software License 2.0
   see http://www.apache.org/licenses/ for more information
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 * Remove a recursive template call in the junit xsls that could trigger a stack
   overflow. It now uses Xalan extensions to call a Java class directly.
   Bugzilla Report 19301
   
 * Fix spurious infinite loop detection for filters (introduced in ant 1.6.0).
   Bugzilla Report 23154.
 
 * Fix handling of default ant namespace for nested elements.
 
 * Fix jboss element of ejb task (introduced in ant 1.6.0).
 
 * Ant could fail to start with a NullPointerException if
   ANT_HOME/lib/ant-launcher.jar was part of the system CLASSPATH.
 
 * presetdef'ed types did not work with the ant-type attribute
 
 * fixed case handling of macrodef attributes and elements. Bugzilla
   Reports 25687 and 26225.
 
 * <java> ignored the append attribute, Bugzilla Report 26137.
 
 * The gcj compiler adapter for <javac> failed if the destination
   directory didn't exist.  Bugzilla Report 25856.
 
 * Ant now fails with a more useful message if a new process will be
   forked in a directory and that directory doesn't exist.
 
 * <splash> used to break the build on non-GUI environments.  Bugzilla
   report 11482.
 
 * Ant 1.6.0 cannot run build scripts in directories with non-ASCII names.
   Bugzilla Report 26642.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 * Shipped XML parser is now Xerces-J 2.6.1
 
 * Translate task logs a debug message specifying the number of files
   that it processed.  Bugzilla Report 13938.
 
 * <fixcrlf> has a new attribute - fixlast. Bugzilla Report 23262.
 
 * <p4submit> has 2 new attributes, needsresolveproperty and changeproperty.
   Bugzilla Report 25711.
 
 * add description attributes to macrodef attributes and elements.
   Bugzilla Report 24711.
 
 * Extending ClearCase Tasks :
  - Added an extra option to 'failonerr' to each ClearCase task/command.
  - Extended the functionality of cccheckout. It can check (notco) to see if
   the desired element is already checked out to the current view. Thus it
    won't attempt to check it out again.
  - Added three new ClearCase commands: ccmkattr, ccmkdir, ccmkelem
   Bugzilla Report 26253.
 
 * New condition <typefound> that can be used to probe for the declaration 
   and implementation of a task, type, preset, macro, scriptdef, whatever. 
   As it tests for the implementation, it can be used to check for optional
   tasks being available. 
 
 * added nested text support to <macrodef>
   
 * added initial support for Java 1.5.  Java 1.5 is now correctly
   detected by Ant and treated just like Java 1.4.  You can now specify
   source="1.5" in the <javac> task.
 
 * created new task <cvsversion>
 
 * added support for branch logging via the tag attribute in <cvschangelog>
   Bugzilla Report 13510.
 
 * added support the groovy language in the script and scriptdef tasks
 
 Changes from Ant 1.5.4 to Ant 1.6.0
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 * This version of Ant can not be built with JDK 1.1 and requires at
   least Java 1.2 at runtime as well.  Compiling for a 1.1 target is
   still supported.
 
 * Targets cannot have the empty string as their name any longer.
 
 * ant.jar's manifest does no longer include a Class-Path entry, so it
   is no longer possible to run Ant via "java -jar ant.jar" without
   manually altering the CLASSPATH.  Instead of that a file
   ant-bootstrap.jar is included in the etc directory of the binary
   distribution, copy this to the lib directory and use
   "java -jar ant-bootstrap.jar" instead if you want to run Ant without
   the wrapper script (not recommended).
 
 * The <script> task now requires Apache BSF instead of the older IBM
   version.  See <http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/>
 
 * <xmlproperty> will no longer fail if the file to be loaded doesn't exist.
 
 * XML namespaces are now enabled in the XML parser, meaning XML namespace
   declarations no longer cause errors. However task names containing colons
   will cause errors unless there is a corresponding namespace uri.
 
 * The <ftp> and <telnet> tasks now require Jakarta Commons Net instead
   of the older ORO Netcomponents version.  See
   <http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/net/index.html>.
 
 * <input> will no longer prompt the user and wait for input if the
   addproperty attribute is set to a property that has already been
   defined in the project.  If you rely on the task waiting for input,
   don't use the addproperty attribute.
 
 * The Class-Path attribute in manifests will no longer merge the
   entries of all manifests found, but will be treated like all other
   manifest attributes - the most recent attribute(s) will be used.
 
 * New Launch mechanism implemented. This moves some functionality from
   the batch files / shell scripts into Java. This removes environment
   limitations, for command issues, directory depth issues on Windows. Also
   allows a per-user library location to be used if the main Ant install
   is locked down.
 
 * The Entry nested element of PropertyFile will not any more have its value
   attribute (actually increment) overwritten with the new value of the entry
   after execution.
 
 * Output stored from a <java> or <exec> task is now exactly as generated. No
   conversion to platform end-of-line characters is performed.
 
 * <translate> will now preserve line endings.
 
 * <ftp> followsymlinks="false" in nested fileset definitions is explicitly
   required in order to exclude remote symbolic links (when doing a get, chmod,
   delete, rmdir).
 
 * The values of the Copy#fileCopyMap variable has changed from String to
   String[]. (In java 1.5 terms it was Hashtable<String, String> and
   is now Hashtable<String, String[]>). This will affect third party code
   that extend Copy and override Copy#doFileOperations.
 
 * <loadproperties> didn't expand properties while <property file="..."/>
   does, so they were not equivalent.  This has been fixed, which means
   that propetries may get expanded twice if you use an
   <expandproperties> filterreader.  Bugzilla Report 17782.
 
 * User defined tasks and typedefs are now handled internally in the
   same way as predefined tasks and typedefs. Also tasks and typedefs
   are resolved at a later stage. This causes some
   differences especially for user defined task containers.
 
 * <checksum> log message "Calculating checksum ..." has been degraded from INFO to VERBOSE.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 * Filter readers were not handling line endings properly.  Bugzilla
   Report 18476.
 
 * Filtersets were also not handling line endings properly.
 
 * Expand tasks did not behave as expected with PatternSets.
 
 * <property environment=... /> now works on OS/400.
 
 * <cab> could hang listcab on large <fileset>s.
 
 * The starteam stcheckout, stcheckin tasks now correctly compute
   status of files against whatever local tree they are run against
   and, optionally, will not process a file if it is current.
   Previously you had to process everything unless you ran against the
   default folder which wasn't the normal use-case for ant-starteam.
   The stlist task now similarly displays that status correctly making
   it a more generally useful tool.
 
 * entity includes would cause exceptions if path names included spaces.
 
 * addConfiguredXXX would not work for TaskAdapter wrapped tasks
 
 * Fix <ilasm> outputfile testing so that the output file does not need
   to exist beforehand.
 
 * Ant will now exit with a return code of 1 if it encounters problems
   with the command line arguments.
 
 * ClassLoader creation changes to use a factory method in Project. A new
   class AntClassLoader2 implemented for 1.2+ specific features including
   Package information and addition of classes specified in the Class-Path
   element of a Jar's manifest.
 
 * It is now possible in <exec> to resolve the executable to a project
   basedir or execution dir relative executable. The resolveExecutable
   must be used to pick up such executables.
 
 * splash screen wouldn't disappear when build was finished.
 
 * <exec> output and error streams can now be redirected independently
   to either a property or a file (or both)
 
 * TarEntry's File-arg constructor would fail with a
   StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on all OSes where os.name is shorter
   than seven characters.  Bugzilla Report 18105.
 
 * <copy> and <move>'s failonerror didn't apply to filesets pointing to
   non-existant directories.  Bugzilla Report 18414.
 
 * The <stripjavacomments> filter sometimes removed parts of string
   constants.  Bugzilla Report 17441.
 
 * <antlr> will now recompile your grammar if the supergrammar has
   changed.  Bugzilla Report 12691.
 
 * <property env> will now work on Unices with /bin/env instead of
   /usr/bin/env.  Bugzilla Report 17642.
 
 * <jar index="on"> could include multiple index lists.  Bugzilla 10262.
 
 * The index created by <jar> didn't conform to the spec as it didn't
   include the top-level entries.  Bugzilla Report 16972.
 
 * <tar> and <zip> didn't honor the defaultexcludes attribute for the
   implicit fileset.  Bugzilla Report 18637.
 
 * The <replacetokens> filter would throw an exception if the token's
   value was an empty string.  Bugzilla Report 18625.
 
 * Perforce tasks relying on output from the server such as <p4change>
   and <p4label> were hanging. Bugzilla Reports 18129 and 18956.
 
 * Improve exception and logging behavior of Perforce tasks.
   Bugzilla report 18154.
 
 * build.sh install had a problem on cygwin (with REALANTHOME).
   Bugzilla Report 17257
 
 * <replaceregexp> didn't work for multi-byte encodings if byline was false.
   Bugzilla Report 19187.
 
 * <replaceregexp> was altering unnecessarily the timestamp of the directories
   containing the files to process
   Bugzilla Report 22541.
 
 * file names that include spaces need to be quoted inside the @argfile
   argument using forked <javac> and (all JDKS).  Bugzilla Report 10499.
   NB : a first correction was only introducing quotes for JDK 1.4
   It has been changed to quote for all external compilers when paths
   contain spaces.
   Also the backslashes need to be converted to forward slashes
   Bugzilla Report 17683.
 
 * Setting filesonly to true in <zip> and related tasks would cause the
   archives to be always recreated.  Bugzilla Report 19449.
 
 * file names that include spaces need to be quoted inside the @argfile
   argument using <javadoc> and JDK 1.4.  Bugzilla Report 16871.
 
 * <junit> didn't work with custom formatters that were only available
   on the user specified classpath when a timeout occured.  Bugzilla
   Report 19953.
 
 * <different> selector : make ignoreFileTimes effectively default to true
   and fix a bug in the comparison of timestamps. Bugzilla Report 20205.
 
 * <different> selector can now be nested directly under a fileset
   Bugzilla Report 20220.
 
 * <cvstagdiff> had a problem with "dd-MM-yy hh:mm:ss" formats
   Bugzilla Report 15995.
 
 * <cvstagdiff> cvsroot and package attributes added to the root
   element tagdiff of the xml output
   Bugzilla Report 16081.
 
 * <cvstagdiff> had a problem with aliased modules and with requests for multiple modules
   Bugzilla Reports 21373 and 22877.
 
 * <cvstagdiff> could not parse properly the revision number of new files with CVS 1.11.9 or higher
   Bugzilla Report 24406.
 
 * <fixcrlf> make fixcrlf create its temporary files in the default directory
   of FileUtils#createTempFile instead of the destination dir of fixcrlf.
   Bugzilla Report 20870.
 
 * <ejbjar> implementation for Borland.
   Prevent the task from being blocked by error messages coming from java2iiop.
   Bugzilla Report 19385.
 
 * <unzip>'s and <untar>'s nested patternsets didn't work as documented
   when the pattern ended in a slash or backslash.  Bugzilla Report 20969.
 
 * <fixcrlf> will now create the parent directories for the destination
   files if necessary.  Bugzilla Report 20840.
 
 * <xmlproperty> now handles CDATA sections. BugZilla Report 17195
 
 * <translate> now translate tokens that are placed close together.
   Bugzilla Report 17297
 
 * Nested websphere element for ejbjar does not support spaces in file name.
   Bugzilla Report 21298
 
 * Don't multiply Class-Path attributes when updating jars.  Bugzilla
   Report 21170.
 
 * Do not overwrite the value (increment) attribute of PropertyFile nested Entry element.
   Bugzilla Report 21505.

   Bugzilla Report 21724.
 
 * ftp chmod failed when the remote system was UNIX and local system Windows
   Bugzilla Report 21865.
 
 * ftp put with chmod failed when the remote system was UNIX and local system Windows
   Bugzilla Report 23143.
 
 * ftp did not set the ascii mode explicity, causing problems with ftp servers
   having binary as default
 
 * ftp was not able to download files when they were pointed to by symbolic links
   Bugzilla Report 14063.
 
 * ftp is able to download also directories pointed to by symbolic links.

 automatic use of response files.  Bugzilla report #19630
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.6.0
 
 * All tasks can be used outside of <target>s.  Note that some tasks
   will not work at all outside of targets as they would cause infinite
   loops (<antcall> as well as <ant> and <subant> if they invoke the
   current build file).
 
 * Six new Clearcase tasks added.
 
 * A new filter reader namely tokenfilter has been added.  Bugzilla
   Report 18312.
 
 * A new attribute named skip is added to the TailFilter and
   HeadFilter filter readers.
 
 * The filesetmanifest attribute of <jar> has been reenabled.
 
 * The start and end tokens for <translate> may now be longer than a
   single character.
 
 * <setproxy> lets you set the username and password for proxies that
   want authentication
 
 * <loadproperties> has a new encoding attribute.
 
 * <echoproperties> can now create XML output.
 
 * <echoproperties> has a new srcfile attribute that can make it read
   properties files and output them instead of Ant's properties.
 
 * <filterset> will now resolve filters recursively.
 
 * <input> has a new attribute that allows you to specify a default value.
 
 * Added <image> task (requires JAI).
 
 * <image> task has now proportions attribute in the <scale/> nested element
   instead of keepproportions (bringing in more functionality)
 
 * New condition <isreference>
 
 * <ftp> now has a preservelastmodified attribute to preserve the
   timestamp of a downloaded file.
 
 * new rmdir action for <ftp> that removes directories from a fileset.
 
 * <ftp> has attributes timediffauto and timediffmillis to use together
   with the newer attribute to tell ant to take into account a time difference
   between client and remote side.
   Bugzilla Report 19358.
 
 * <ftp> has been optimized to go directly to the include patterns.
   This reduces scanning time under UNIX when followsymlinks="true"
   and casesensitive="true" (the default)
   Bugzilla Report 20103.
 
 * The SOS and VSS tasks will no longer unconditionally prepend a $ to
   vsspath or projectpath.
 
 * OS/400 now gets detected by the os condition.
 
 * <arg> has a new attribute pathref that can be used to reference
   previously defined paths.
 
 * <xmlproperty> has been improved, you can now expand ${properties},
   define ids or paths and use Ant's location magic for filename resolutions
   in the XML file.
 
 * <xmlcatalog> will now support external catalogs according to the
   OASIS "Open Catalog" standard - if resolver.jar (newer than version
   1.0) from Apache's xml-commons is in your CLASSPATH.
 
 * Starteam tasks now have support for revision labels and build labels.
   Checkouts now have the option of using repository timestamps, instead
   of current.
 
 * new task <symlink> that creates and maintains symbolic links.
 
 * new tasks <chown> and <chgrp> which are wrappers of the Unix commands.
 
 * new task <attrib> to change file attributes on Windows systems.
 
 * <style> has a new attribute reloadstylesheet to work around a
   bug in widespread Xalan versions.
 
 * <tarfileset> has a new dirmode attribute to specify the permissions
   for directories.
 
 * <fixcrlf>'s eol attribute now also understands "mac", "unix" and "dos".
 
 * <classfileset> now picks up dependencies of the form MyClass.class. This
   works for the code generated by the Sun java compiler. It may not work for
   all compilers.
 
 * a new attribute "globalopts" can be added to all Perforce tasks.
   You can put in it all the strings described by p4 help usage. Refer to
   the docs for more information.
 
 * new Perforce tasks <p4integrate> , <p4resolve>, and <p4labelsync>
 
 * <p4submit> will change the property p4.change if the Perforce server
   renumbers the change list.
   It will set the property p4.needsresolve if the submit fails,
   and the message says that file(s) need to be resolved.
 
 * <replaceregexp> now has an optional encoding attribute to support
   replacing in files that are in a different encoding than the
   platform's default.
 
 * The <exec> task may now have its input redirected from either a file
   or a string from the build file. The error output can be separated
   to a different file when outut is redirected. standard error may be
   logged to the Ant log when redirecting output to a file
 
 * The <java> task also supports the input redirection and separate
   error streams introduced to the <exec> task. In addition, it is now
   possible to save the output into a property for use within the build
   file as was possible with <exec> in Ant 1.5
 
 * The <javadoc> task <tag> subelement has been enhanced to allow files
   with tag mappings to be used.
 
 * New tasks: <scp> supports file transfers, <sshexec> executes a
   command over SSH.  They require jsch, a BSD licensed SSH library that
   can be found at http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/index.html
 
 * New filterreader <escapeunicode/>.
 
 * Support for HP's NonStop Kernel (Tandem) OS has been added.
 
 * <cab>'s basedir attribute is now optional if you specify nested
   filesets.  Bugzilla Report 18046.
 
 * New task <sync> that synchronizes two directory trees.
 
 * <apply> has new forwardslash attribute that can force filenames to
   use forward slashes (/) as file separators even on platforms with a

 Changes from Ant 1.5.3 to Ant 1.5.4
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 * If the Visual Age tasks used to work for you, they may stop doing so
   now - and we'd like to know about it.  The current set of tasks is
   supposed to work with any version of VAJ starting with 3.0.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * The Visual Age for Java tasks didn't work (at least for versions 3.0
   and higher).  Bugzilla Report 10016.
 
 * URL-encoding in <vaj*port> didn't work properly.
 
 * VAJRemoteUtil called getAbsolutePath instead of getPath
   causing problems when using a Windows VAJ server from a UNIX server.
   Bugzilla Report 20457.
 
 * VAJImport task failed with NullPointerException when using DirectoryScanner.
   Bugzilla Report 22080.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.5.0
 
 * <javah> will invoke oldjavah on JDK 1.4.2.  Bugzilla Report 18667.
 
 * The VAJ tasks now support a haltonfailure attribute to conditionally
   keep building even if they fail.
 
 * It is now possible to use the latest (versioned or unversioned) edition
   in <vajload> by using special wildcard characters.  Also fixes
   Bugzilla Report 2236.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.5.2 to Ant 1.5.3
 ===================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 
 * The <zip> task and friends have again changed a method signature
   (sorry, was necessary to fix bug 17780).  The return type of
   getResourcesToAdd has changed.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * <zipfileset>'s filemode would get ignored and the dirmode was used
   for the included files as well.  As a side effect, WinZIP was unable
   to extract or display the files, so they seemed to be missing from
   the archive.  Bugzilla Report 17648.
 
 * <ftp> could use the wrong path separator when trying to change the
   remote working directory.  Bugzilla Report 17735.
 
 * <jar update="true"> would loose all original files if you didn't
   specify any nested <(zip)fileset>s and the manifest had changed.
   Bugzilla Report 17780.
 
 * If you used a value starting with \ on Windows for the appxml
   attribute of <ear> or the webxml attribute of <war>, it would be
   ignored.  Bugzilla Report 17871.
 
 * Ant will no longer implicitly add Sun's rt.jar in <javac> when you
   use jvc and don't specify a bootclasspath.  Bugzilla Report 18055.
 
 * The prefix attribute of <zipfileset> would not generate directory
   entries for the prefix itself.  Bugzilla Report 18403.
 
 * starteam checkout can now handle deleted labels.  Bugzilla Report 17646.
 
 * The Unix wrapper script failed if you invoked it as a relative
   symlink and ANT_HOME has not been set.  Bugzilla Report 17721.
 
 Other Changes:
 --------------
 * Added ability to specify manifest encoding for the <jar> and
   <manifest> tasks
 
 Changes from Ant 1.5.1 to Ant 1.5.2
 =============================================
 
 Changes that could break older environments:
 --------------------------------------------
 * ANT_OPTS environment variable is now applied at the start of the
   Java command line, allowing position specific parameters of some
   JVMs, such as -classic to be specified.
 
 * ZipScanner#getIncludedFiles will now return the names of the ZipEntries
   that have been matched instead of the name of the archive.
 
 * The <zip> task and friends have been heavily modified, almost every
   method signature of the Zip class has changed.  If you have subclassed
   Zip (or one of its subclasses), your class will most likely not
   compile against the current code base.  If it still compiles, it will
   probably not work as in Ant 1.5.1.
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 * <translate> was not ignoring comment lines.
 
 * <manifest> wouldn't update an existing manifest if only an attribute
   of an existing section changed.
 
 * ant.bat now supports the ANT_ARGS and JAVACMD environment variables
   again (like Ant 1.5 did).
 
 * The "plain" <junit> <formatter> could throw a NullPointerException
   if an error occured in setUp.
 
 * <junit> will now produce output when a test times out as well.
 
 * <replace> would count some internal character replacements when
   reporting the number of replaced tokens.
 
 * <concat> would cause an exception if a <filelist> pointed to files
   that do not exist.
 
 * <javadoc> will now pass -source to custom doclets as well.
 
 * <cvstagdiff> would throw a NullPointException if there had been no
   differences.
 
 * <cvschangelog> could miss today's changes.
 
 * <concat> could append newline characters between concatenated files.
 
 * <xmlvalidate> ignored the specified encoding of the files to
   validate.
 
 * the errorsbeginat attribute of the <http> condition didn't work.
 
 * Ant will try to force loading of certain packages like com.sun.*
   from the system classloader.  The packages are determined by the
   version of the JVM running Ant.
 
 * Ant didn't find the runtime libraries on IBM's JDK 1.4 for Linux.
 
 * random component of temporary files is now always a positive integer.
 
 * Ant could incorrectly try to use the 1.4 regexp implementation even
   if it isn't available if you run the JVM with -Xverify:none.
 
 * Ant would die with an exception if you used nested <reference>
   elements in Ant and the refid attribute didn't point to an existing
   project reference.
 
 * The <get> task can now be compiled (and Ant thus bootstrapped) using
   Kaffee.
 
 * build.sysclasspath will now be honored by more tasks.
 
 * The signjar keystore attribute has been reverted to a String allowing
   it to once again accept URLs. This should not affect current File based usage
   unless you are extending the Signjar task.
 
 * <jar update="true"> would remove the original manifest.
 
 * fix up folder creation in PVCS task
 
 * <tar>'s up-to-date check didn't work for nested <(tar)fileset>s.
 
 * Corrected a problem in XMLLogger where it would not associated
   messages with a taskdef'd task
 
 * <uptodate> now works when using attributes (i.e. not filesets) and pointing
   to the same file
 
 * Java task (and output system) now stores output which doos not end
   with a line feed.
 
 * splash screen wouldn't disappear when build was finished.
 
 * <exec> now supports OS/2.
 
 * <zip> and friends would only update/recreate existing archives if
   the files to add/update have been newer than the archive.
 
 * <javadoc>'s <link> element could fail for offline="true" on some JDKs.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * MailLogger now sets the Date header correctly.
 
 * Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.3.0
 
 * signjar now accepts a maxmemory attribute to allow the memory allocated to the
   jarsigner tool to be specified. The jarsigner from the JDK's JAVA_HOME bin
   dir is now used rather than the first jarsigner on the path.
 
 * **/.DS_Store has been added to the list of default pattern excludes.
 
 * The Created-By header in the default manifest now contains the JVM
   vendor and version according to the jar specification. A new header,
   Ant-Version provides the Ant version used to create the jar.
 
 * <zip> can now store Unix permissions in a way that can be
   reconstructed by Info-Zip's unzip command.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.5.1Beta1 to 1.5.1
 ====================================
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 
 * <tstamp>'s prefix attribute failed to apply to nested <format> elements.
 
 * <junitreport> created an empty junit-noframes.html if no format had
   been specified.
 
 * <basename> would remove more than it should if the file name
   contained more than one dot.
 
 * <filterset>s nested into <filterset>s didn't work.
 
 Other changes:
 --------------
 
 * Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.2.0
 
 * Filesets now support a 'file' attribute, allowing a single-file
   fileset to be constructed without having to specify its parent
   directory separately.
 
 * <junit> will now return the result of a call to getName instead of
   "unknown" for Test implementations that don't extend TestCase but have
   a public String getName() method.
 
 Changes from Ant 1.5 to 1.5.1Beta1
 ==================================
 
 Fixed bugs:
 -----------
 * Date/time in CvsChangeLog was in local timezone and 12 hour format leading
   to a problem when sorting by time. It is now UTC (GMT) and in 24-hour
   format as per cvs 'specifications'.
 
 * CvsTagDiff now supports ampersand modules or modules that have a different
   root directory than their name.
